						<p class="contenuto" id="box1">Metadata is "data about data". As information has become increas. The main purpose of metadata is to facilitate in the discovery of relevant information, more often classified as resource discovery. Metadata also helps organize electronic resources, provide digital identification, and helps support archiving and preservation of the resource.</p> 
						<p class="contenuto" id="box2">Process of gathering and measuring information on variables of interest, in an systematic method that enables one to answer stated research questions, test hypotheses, and evaluate outcomes. The goal is to capture quality evidence that then translates to rich data analysis and allows the building of a convincing and credible answer to questions that have been posed.</p>
						<p class="contenuto" id="box3">Computational process of discovering patterns in large data sets involving methods at the intersection of artificial intelligence, machine learning, statistics, and database systems. The overall goal of the data mining process is to extract information from a data set and transform it into an understandable structure for further use.</p>

						<p class="contenuto" id="box4">An interdisciplinary subfield of computer science, the computational process of discovering patterns in large data sets involving methods at the intersection of artificial intelligence, machine learning, statistics, and database systems. The overall goal of the data mining process is to extract information from a data set and transform it into an understandable structure for further use.</p>

						<p class="contenuto" id="box5">It states that government surveillance programs do not threaten privacy unless they uncover illegal activities. Hence, a person who favors this argument may state "I've got nothing to hide" and therefore does not express opposition to government surveillance. The motto "If you've got nothing to hide, you've got nothing to fear" has been used in the closed-circuit television program practiced in cities in the United Kingdom.</p>

						<p class="contenuto" id="box6">Person who exposes misconduct, alleged dishonest or illegal activity occurring in an organization. The alleged misconduct may be classified in many ways; for example, a violation of a law, rule, regulation and/or a direct threat to public interest, such as fraud, health and safety violations, and corruption.</p>

						<p class="contenuto" id="box7">Signals intelligence is intelligence-gathering by interception of signals, whether communications between people or from electronic signals not directly used in communication. As sensitive information is often encrypted, signals intelligence often involves the use of cryptanalysis to decipher the messages. Traffic analysis—the study of who is signaling whom and in what quantity - is also used to derive information.</p>

						<p class="contenuto" id="box8">The "Five Eyes", often abbreviated as "FVEY", refer to an intelligence alliance comprising Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. These countries are bound by the multilateral UKUSA Agreement, a treaty for joint cooperation in signals intelligence.</p>

						<p class="contenuto" id="box9">The Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) is a British intelligence and security organisation responsible for providing signals intelligence (SIGINT) and information assurance to the British government and armed forces.</p>

						<p class="contenuto" id="2box1">The title stands for "Uniting and Strengthening America by Fulfilling Rights and Ending Eavesdropping, Dragnet-collection and Online Monitoring Act." The aim was to end the bulk collection of Americans' metadata, end the secret laws created by the FISA court, and introduce a "Special Advocate" to represent public and privacy matters. The Senate voted on November 18, 2014: fifty-four Democrats and four Republicans who supported consideration failed to muster the 60 votes required. </p> 
						<p class="contenuto" id="2box2">Section 702, 703, 704 - Amends Fisa and requires the establishment of procedures for targeting non-US persons overseas. The government may not intentionally target a US person but the NSA has revealed that it does unintentionally collect American communications. In these cases, surveillance of a US person can be authorized without a warrant because the US person is outside the country.</p>

						<p class="contenuto" id="2box3">Fisa provides the foundation for foreign intelligence surveillance. The Act establishes procedures for the collection of this intelligence, and a secret court to oversee those activities. Fisa has been amended since to allow for increased warrantless surveillance.</p>

						<p class="contenuto" id="2box4">These orders are issued to compel entities to furnish information the government has requested. The court operates in secrecy and is not subject to public oversight.</p>

						<p class="contenuto" id="2box5">Sections 214, 215, 216 - Amends FISA, allowing the government to order the collection of "tangible things" that aid in an terrorism or espionage investigation. These "things" don't need to pertain directly to a target but instead only be relevant to an investigation.</p>

						<p class="contenuto" id="2box6">National security letters are administrative subpoenas that allow the FBI to compel the recipient to divulge subscriber and billing information relevant to a national security investigation. These letters require no judicial review and the recipient is prohibited from revealing the contents or existence of the letter.</p>

						<p class="contenuto" id="2box7">Signed in 1981 by President Reagan, and most recently amended by President Bush in 2004, this order broadly authorizes the collection of all information for the purpose of "national defense" not prohibited by other applicable laws.</p>

Don't Spy On Us is calling for an inquiry to investigate the extent to which the law has failed and suggest new legislation.<a style="color:grey" href="https://www.dontspyonus.org.uk/englishpen" target="_blank"></br>→ see the website</a> </p> 
						<p class="contenuto" id="3box2">Under the name Writers Against Mass Surveillance a small group of authors has launched an appeal that has been signed by more than 500 writers from around the world, including five Nobel laureates. The writers demand a binding “International Bill of Digital Rights” and call upon the United Nations to enforce fundamental democratic rights such as the presumption of innocence and the right to privacy in the digital realm. <a style="color:grey" href="http://www.change.org/surveillance" target="_blank"></br>→ see the website</a></p>

						<p class="contenuto" id="3box3">A coalition of nearly two-dozen tech companies and civil liberties groups fighting against mass internet surveillance.The new coalition, organized by Fight for the Future, is planning a Reset the Netday of action on June 5, the anniversary of the date the first Edward Snowden story broke detailing the government’s PRISM program, based on documents leaked by the former NSA contractor.<a style="color:grey" href="https://www.resetthenet.org" target="_blank"></br>→ see the website</a></p>

						<p class="contenuto" id="3box4">Back was a one-day global protest against mass surveillance by the US National Security Agency (NSA), the UK GCHQ, and the other Five Eyespartners involved in global surveillance. The "digital protest" took place on February 11, 2014 with more than 6,000 participating websites which primarily took the form of a webpage banner-advertisements. Organizers hoped lawmakers would be made aware "that there's going to be ongoing public pressure until these reforms are instituted.”<a style="color:grey" href="https://thedaywefightback.org" target="_blank"></br>→ see the website</a></p>

						<p class="contenuto" id="3box5">StopWatching.us is a coalition of more than 100 public advocacy organizations and companies from across the political spectrum.

						<p class="contenuto" id="4box1">Anti-terrorism mass surveillance data mining program launched in 2007 by NSA, with participation from an unknown date by the British equivalent agency, GCHQ. The Prism program collects stored Internet communications based on demands made to Internet companies such as Google Inc. under Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 to turn over any data that match court-approved search terms. The NSA can use it to target communications that were encrypted and made easier to handle.</p> 
						<p class="contenuto" id="4box2">Originally a code-name, is now used to describe a signals intelligence (SIGINT) collection and analysis network operated on behalf of the five signatory nations to the UKUSA Security Agreement — Five Eyes. It was created in the early 1960s to monitor the military and diplomatic communications of the Soviet Union and its Eastern Bloc allies during the Cold War.</p>

						<p class="contenuto" id="4box3">Code name of information collected under the President's Surveillance Program (PSP). The National Security Agency (NSA) program was approved by President George W. Bush shortly after the September 11 2001 attacks and was revealed by Thomas Tamm to The New York Times in 2008. Stellar Wind was a prelude to new legal structures that allowed Bush and then President Obama to reproduce each of those programs and expand their reach.</p>

						<p class="contenuto" id="4box4">Acronym for COunter INTELligence PROgram - Series of covert, and at times illegal, projects conducted by the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) aimed at surveying, infiltrating, discrediting, and disrupting domestic political organizations.
