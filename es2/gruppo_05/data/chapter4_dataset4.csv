Their commander is a Colonel Samuels.
- I've never heard of this unit. - No; you wouldn't have. That's the point.
They'd be buried pretty heavily in NSA's budget.
NSA.
OK.

OK.
Even if NSA originally trained him; isn't it possible he's freelancing now? A mercenary?
NSA.
OK.

If it was just the tattoo; I'd agree with you.
But the men that attacked us had access to our flight plan.
What about a special ops units from down there called Coral Snake?
No; sir. Nothing.
How could NSA be funding a paramilitary group and you not know about it?
Without knowing specifics; I really can't say for sure.
My guess is that the Department of Defense
has used some of their discretionary resources;
attached our name for budgetary purposes. It happens all the time.
That's absurd. NSA is information gathering only. They have no military mandate.
I'd assume that this Coral Snake group;
like many others that we see;
I just spoke to Roger Stanton.
I think he's hiding something from me. I'm going to arrest him.
Arrest the head of NSA?
Bauer said the unit that attacked his plane is connected to a Colonel Samuels.
Samuels is funded by NSA.

Samuels is funded by NSA.
With all due respect; David; that's pretty thin.
By itself; yes.
If you do nothing and he is guilty of something; you'll be blamed anyway.
No; no; no. At the very least; we need to get some kind of proof; some evidence.
You cannot just arrest the head of NSA; David.
Sherry's right; Mike. We need proof.
Find me a connection between Stanton and this Colonel Samuels. And find it quickly.
There's a back-channel communications network the CIA used to use; called OPCOM.
It's been shut down for over 20 years.
Last month; NSA was given orders to resurrect it.
It was an eyes-only order issued by Roger Stanton.
- I'm not sure that's enough. - By itself; it's not.

OK.

It's an EMP!
What the hell's happening?
Contact NSA.
Terrorists just took down CTU.
Central comm node is totally fried.
Now it's gone.
See if NYPD can get some units down here.
I'll contact NSA; see if they've got
surveillance of the area.
That's weird.
all bridge and tunnel traffic into the city.
Thanks. Done.
Where are you going? NSA's shutting
all bridge and tunnel traffic into the city.
There's only one way for them to get in.
Now it's gone.
See if NYPD can get some units down here.
I'll contact NSA; see if they've got
surveillance of the area.
That's weird.
Okay; give me another update in 20 minutes.
Excuse me; sir?
Yes; what is it? A team from NSA is here.
NSA?
Brian Hastings;
It's an EMP!

NSA?
Brian Hastings;
director of CTU.
when we lost contact with him.
Do you know where he is?
NSA's been trying to call him back.
He's not answering.
They're not sure why.
All right; people; listen up.
This is Frank Haynam;
senior engineer of the NSA's New York field office.
Now; he and his team are going to help us
restore aerial surveillance and communications.
Agent Blochard; can you get Mr. Haynam and his team
down to the server room?
Has NSA heard from Jack?
Yeah. They spoke with Jack
and his team about 20 minutes ago;
from the sky.
Just let it go.
These NSA guys seem to know what they're doing.
And if they don't; what happens to Jack?
What's Jack got to do with this?
Uh; what-what do you mean? What-what kind of trouble?
Jack was tracking the terrorists when the EMP hit.
Uh; whHe called NSA; mean? and they lost contact; too.
Does Hastings know about this?
He's the one who told me.
you can direct me to him.
Yeah; well; that might take a while.
NSA brought in a repair team
and they're going about it all wrong.
I have a faster way to get us back online.

Count on it.
You were supposed
to be coordinating with NSA;
monitoring chatter.
I know; something came up; I had to take care of it.
I accidentally deleted from archives.
I didn't have clearance.
I'm uplinking to NSA servers now.
All right.
Just get on it.
We're going to expand the search.
Coordinate with metro police to set up a point-by-point grid encompassing a ten-mile radius.
And talk with nsa.
I want to back all of this up with synchronized satellite sweeps.
I'll do what I can.
Larry; I don't think it's worth it.
There's nothing here.
All righ fine; help janis coordinate with nsa.
I'm sorry about renee; larry. She was a good agent.
We don't know that she's dead yet!
I understand; bob.
All right; thanks.
That was bob cornell at nsa.
They've detected another firewall breach.
There's been another attack?
Well; I'm giving it to you now.
- We're out of options. - We're not; ethan.
The nsa is attempting to localize what part of the infrastructure is being targeted;
and the fbi is still trying to track down the cip device.
I'll keep an open channel with both agencies.
Descend and maintain flight level 270.
Call the white house.
The latest report from the nsa.
- I can summarize it for you. - Go ahead.
They'vhad no luck in localizing the firewall breach.
There's nothing here.
All right. Fine;
Help Janis coordinate with NSA.
I'm sorry about renee.
She was a good agent.
- And local agencies. - Yes;sir.
- Larry;I think I found something. - Yeah?
I've been working NSA;trying to back-trace the CIP attack
That took down the two planes.
And I found a code fragment
Okay;copy that.
Come on.
The entire NSA has been combing the firewall.
Searching for the next CIP device breach.
If this were something;don't you think
It's a really powerful processor.
- It could be driving the CIP device. - Copy.
NSA's classified infrastructure team
- is trying to plug the firewall breach. - Any luck so far?
- None so far;but they're staying on it. - They have less than
What are you talking about?
No CIP intrusion;the firewall is secure.
How? NSA?
I don't know.
Bring the CIP module.
He's gone. We need to get back to the safe house.
Let's go.
Sean;this says both NSA and homeland have no idea
Why the breach at the Kidron plan was stopped.
They're still looking.
That's what concerns me.
Sorry;sir.
I want you and Janis to work with NSA.
Find out where that CIP device is being used.
If we find the device;we find Dubaku.
If we find the device;we find Dubaku.
I appreciate the call. Thanks a lot.
Janis;Larry wants you to interface with NSA.
See if you can back-trace that CIP code fragment to its source.
I'll try.
to distribute it to every government agency
and media outlet. President Taylor's already censored the press.
NSA's putting up firewalls.
Arlo's working on getting through them right now.
The president can't lock down
- Bauer's actions are CTU's responsibility. - We won't run from this.
- Let's find out who they are. - Send in forensic teams?
- Yeah. - NSA andfield units?
- Yeah; that's fine. - (phone rings)
(woman) Mr Almeida; Kim Bauer on line four.
We believe is ultimately gonna lead us to Fayed
but we need Chloe to give us satellite support.
Loggin' on to the NSA server now.
Jack; Fayed just contacted the President Palmer
and demanded he releases the prisonners we're holding in Palmdale.
It's coming up. Is Jack on the line?
I'm here; Bill.
We're redirecting the NSA satellite
to the area around Sand Canyon road exit mark.
As soon as we have a fix on Assad's vehicle
Provided the; uh; encryption isn't military grade or better.
I doubt Roger would have had access to anything like that.
He also said you'd have a lot easier job if you just went to the NSA.
Not until we know how badly my wife's administration's been compromised.
My friend said he'd meet us at his apartment in 20 minutes.
I mean; if that's okay with you.
- Yes? - Larry?
NSA just relayed a call they intercepted to us.
Renee was referenced.
Referenced how?
It's not going to change the content of the call; Janis.
I know; I just...
What's on the NSA intercept?
What? You said Renee was referenced. What's on it?
It's only a fragment; but she's referenced; yeah.
Take him to holding.
Arlo got a cell phone intercept report
off of NSA's Echelon.
Hassan; Russian government; Jack Bauer.
Did Arlo hear any of the conversation? No; not yet - all he's got
Dod has recommended that we deploy mobile teams to sweep the area for radioactive and biological signatures.
I'll call phillip at the pentagon and push it through.
What about nsa?
There's elevated anti-american chatter coming from the usual web sites
and telephone traffic;but nothing specific to the attack.
websites and e-mails.
And data-mining all
NSA and CIA intelligence
on jihadist activities over the past six months.
JANIS: Excuse me.
Parameter-matching on Jack; Cole; or Dana.
We don't have anywhere near the bandwidth to do that citywide.
Then job the overflow to NSA.
Where are we on setting up the search grid with NYPD?
In process.
Those drones right now are
our only way of tracking down those terrorists.
You need to pass them off to the NSA.
Damn it; we're blind.
Chloe; did you cop... Chloe?!
As allies; we've requested this WET list
many times before.
But the NSA has always said;
giving us the list would
jeopardize their operations.
jeopardize their operations.
It will.
I don't work for the NSA; I don't work for CTU.
This is personal.
And right now; you're not giving me another choice.
O'Brian.
Chloe; it's Jack.
Do we still have a back door into NSA's
secured mainframe?
I can't really talk right now; Jack.
I'm saying I can't.
They took my keycard.
I can't get into the NSA mainframe without it.
Just do what you have to.
It's our only way to get Bierko.
I'll pay for the dry cleaning.
JACK: Yeah?
Jack; I got on the NSA server.
Did you get the file?
Not yet. They put an extra layer
Why don't you tell us; Ms. O'Brian?
I don't know.
We've got you hacking into a top secret NSA archive.
I don't know what you're talking about.
MILES: I pulled a mirrored archive
MILES: I pulled a mirrored archive
of your web traffic.
Whatever you took from NSA
was uploaded to Jack Bauer's
remote node.
BUCHANAN: Chloe;
this is going to get much worse if you force me
to have NSA run a back trace.
What is it?
Jack needed the WET List.
No; it left the satellite grid.
Damn it. Put out an APB on that car.
- Yes; sir. - Scan the NSA servers.
- See if they've picked up any chatter. - Yes; sir.
Mr. Hastings; the President's on line one;
That's one of ours.
It's one of the cell phones
NSA provided to us right after the EMP hit.
Who was issued that phone?
They were logged in by hand; hold on.
Madam President; we need you in the situation room.
We'll know something very soon.
NSA just red-flagged a live feed going out on the Internet.
It's President Hassan.
Put it through.
When?
Today.
Get me Eric Rayburn; NSA.
I wish Nicole could have come. She loves it out here.
Yeah.
I know you wanna spend time with him. I'm sorry; sir.
- How bad is the situation? - I don't know; but I don't have a good feeling.
To my knowledge; no president's been rerouted by NSA on a morning off.
Thank you.
I didn't know how you liked intel presented at impromtus;
That's fine.
- Mr Mason. - What?
I just got off the phone with Eric Rayburn's office at NSA.
They've a request; sir. They want you to take care of it right away.
This can't be right. Eileen; get me Rayburn.
I think he's up in Oregon with the president. Put it in my office.
What was that about?
NSA wants us to bring in Jack Bauer.
What? What for?
I don't know. That's all they said. Isn't Bauer inactive?
This picture wasn't analysed until after the two had separated.
I've contacted Defense; CIA; FBI and local jurisdictions.
- Everything will be run through NSA. - Who controls Faheen?
Relatively new splinter group that goes by the name of Second Wave.
Government affiliation?
Heads up. I need all department heads over here right now.
We've an active priority.
I just got off a conference call with NSA and Division.
It appears there's a nuclear bomb; under terrorist control;
somewhere here in Los Angeles; set to go off at some point in the course of the day; so...
So let's do it.
George.
- I still haven't been able to reach Jack. - NSA got hold of him.
Is this why they wanted him? I mean; he's been out of play for over a year.
I'm guessing it has something to do with one of his previous covers.
Intel says it's going off today.
- How good's your intel? - Very.
NSA have high-probability leads on regional cells that might be involved.
How close are you to IDing a prime suspect?
Not close at all.
- Anyone could have done the job. - Settle down; George; all right?
Let's sit down; regroup and figure out what we're gonna do.
What we're gonna do? We're gonna call NSA. Now.
Here's the deal. I want Knoll or Grothy to pick up my daughter
and take her a safe distance outside of this city.
And he's actually awaiting trial right now on new charges.
- If he's convicted; he goes away for life. - What's Wald's connection?
NSA established meetings between him and the group behind the threat.
- Why didn't you pick Wald up? - We haven't tracked him down yet.
He's not at any of the addresses in his file.
Can you do it? Can you do it?
That's a good answer.
It's Eric Rayburn from NSA.
Mr Rayburn? This is Tony Almeida.
I understand you're the ranking agent on site. Is that correct?
- Paula. - Yeah.
- I need to pull you off your SIM analysis. - I'm almost done.
I want you to sort and send data to the NSA server; everything relevant to the nuke; OK?
- When do you need it done? - Right now.
I'm gonna have to generate a fresh encryption code.
- I'm gonna need to use Mr Mason's office. - Just do it; please. Thank you.
Tony; what's going on? First the phone lines go down
and then NSA puts in a rush order for us to transfer all our data on the nuke?
He says it's precautionary.
Then he would have issued the same order to every other agency.
- Your phone; sir. - I'm gonna have to get back to you.
George; look;
NSA ordered us to send them our case database.
Paula's already on it; but I sense they're keeping us out of the loop on something.
They're consolidating data from all agencies.
He said there are bombs planted here; here and here. I'll have a squad check it out.
- Order an evacuation. - We don't know...
This is why NSA wanted us to transfer over our database.
They knew we were being targeted and didn't say a thing. We have to evacuate now.
Everyone; listen up.
Everyone; listen up.
This is Lynne Kresge. I'm calling to tell you about a possible threat to CTU.
We just found out about it. NSA knew about this a half an hour ago.
- That's why Rayburn wanted our files. - Right now get your people out.
I want you to go down this hallway and calmly clear everyone out.
I just got off the phone with sid paulson at northeast three air traffic control.
Almeida's group is definitely in their system.
Larry... nsa just detected it.
They're trying to locate the point of entry; but they're not optimistic.
Forget where they got into the system. How the hell do we get them out?
Renee thinks s has the sniper locked in the columbia building.
There are swat teams on the way; coordinate with them. - Okay.
Anything else from nsa on how we get through to that plane?
No; but we talked to one of the men who worked with latham;
who said that based on the way the firewall was breeched; he doesn't think we can contact.
yeah? - Yeah; it's agent moss.
Hey; got any help for us?
Nsa's nowhere. What about you?
We're trying to contact passengers.
So far we haven't been able to get through tanyone.
but these people have proven what they can do;
and at any time;can sabotage air traffic or any of the infrastructure systems we have beyond the firewall.
Does nsa have a timeframe on fixing it so we can keep these pele out permanently?
Madame president;the cip firewall was the result of a multi-year project.
Reengineering the code could take weeks or months.
Madame president;the cip firewall was the result of a multi-year project.
Reengineering the code could take weeks or months.
At this point;nsa just doesn't know.
Exactly what systems are vulnerable;dr.Cornell?
At the top of the list would be the national power grid.
Start with Stanton.
Stanton?
The head of NSA; conspiring against the president of the United States?
Aside from the implications if that were true; hasn't he always been an ally to you?
Yes. But he's also Eric Rayburn's boss.
I didn't have to warn you. I came here on my own accord.
Terrorists have planned a strike against Los Angeles.
NSA thinks it'll be today.
What kind of strike?
Nuclear.
I'm asking: help me; Sherry.
I got a phone call... a few months ago in the middle of the night
from a friend of mine who's high up in NSA.
He told me that Roger Stanton wanted to speak to me first thing in the morning;
and so we met at a park in Virginia.
Absolutely.
So where are we on everything else?
Well; NSA is taking a two-pronged approach.
They're trying to pick up a trail on any known Second Wave terrorists;
and they're also trying to source stolen weapons-grade nuclear materials.
If we pick 'em up; are they gonna lead us to Wald in time?
I don't know.
Well; stick with them until they do. NSA just upgraded his probable role in today's threat.
Put him just a click away from the Second Wave terrorists.
OK; I'll try and figure something out.
And why were you tortured?
Because you thought I knew more than I was saying about the location of the bomb.
As if the head of NSA would withhold information from the president.
You're lying. This may work for a while; but eventually the truth will come out.
I have nothing to fear from the truth; Mr President.
Prior to that; worked in the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs for the Russian Federation.
No red flags from NSA; Interpol or CIA.
As far as they're concerned;
he's clean.
Is it here or at CTU?
Oh; it's very much here; sir.
I had NSA run a data sort
on all White House phone calls and e-mails
over the last two and half hours.
We're still at a dead end on finding new leads.
Excuse me; there might be an attack on President Suvarov's motorcade.
- What? - Edgar monitored some chatter from NSA.
Why are you analysing chatter unrelated to the gas?
- It came through on one of my filters. - We found something.
Has it occurred to you that if this is real;
then it's likely the terrorists who have the Sentox are the ones planning this attack?
This is an unverified threat. If you want to hand it off to NSA; be my guest.
NSA can't recall the motorcade without a time-consuming approval process.
Good! That process helps eliminate false threats.

- Look; we don't have that time. - Ms Raines! Ms Raines.
I need you to download a visual of his vehicle on my PDA.
He was leaving Logan's retreat just before 1:00.
On it. Open up the parallel channel on the NSA's landsats;
can radial slices in three mile increments;
emanating from the Retreat... sir.
I remain convinced
that implementing this plan would be a terrible mistake.
15 minutes ago; the NSA picked up a conversation
between McCarthy and Fayed.
McCarthy's found another engineer
That only works on cell-to-cell communication.
This call was placed from a hardline.
NSA recently started using satellite carrier systems
as a backup for all phone traffic.
You just have to reconfigure the embedded decryption program
We know that President Hassan was handed over
at that location approximately ten minutes ago.
NSA feed only gives us still images.
We might have missed him.
We didn't. There's Bishop's SUV.
He didn't get a plate.
Chloe; can we roll back satellite?
We can now. Nsa just rerouted them.
I'm logging onto their server now.
This is from one minute ago.
If Jack was on that train; he'll have been caught on camera. I want visual confirmation.
- Yes; sir. - Sir; you need to hear this.
It's a cellphone call red-tagged from the NSA software.
Fayed; something went wrong. I'm here at Union Station...
We need to contact the White House.
I'm being set up; just like you were yesterday.
I need to get this evidence to you.
Arlo got a cell phone intercept report off NSA's Echelon.
Keywords: "Jack Bauer."
PILLAR: We confirmed the voiceprint.
- How bad is she? - She needs surgery.
- We can't do that in the field. - George; we can't keep her here.
Everything on this nuke has been destroyed apart from the database Paula sent the NSA;
- and they didn't get the code. - Assign other IT people to retrieve it.
We don't have time!
You're the only one who has 'em.
- Stay with us; Paula. - Paula.
You were transferring files out to NSA. Do you remember that?
- Yeah. - The transfer didn't complete.
They didn't have the source decryption key.
- What about you? - I'll take your post. Go.
Yes; sir.
That was NSA. CTU hasn't transferred the search operation to their jurisdiction.
- What's the problem? - I don't know.
Call Lynn McGill; make sure we're in charge.
So where are we on this?
Jack's last known position is here.
N.S.A. Says they might be able to reposition a satellite...
- but it's gonna take at least two orbits to get it over. - That'll be too late.
Sporadic satellite coverage is probably why...
That connection is still circumstantial.
He's been sabotaging our efforts to find the bomb all day.
I cannot and I will not allow him to continue heading up NSA.
I'm only saying it's going to take time to get a judge to issue a warrant.
- We don't have time; Mike. - Then don't worry about a pretext.
Good. You understand the gravity of today's situation?
Of course; sir.
I guess you've heard that Roger Stanton's no longer functioning as the head of NSA.
- I heard he was arrested. - He was; under my authority.
What I'm about to ask you to do falls outside the parameters of your Secret Service charge.
20 wounded and seven missing.
We're bleeding bad here; George. All of our intel on the nuke was destroyed.
It's on the NSA server but Paula wrote the decryption code and she's in bad shape.
- Do whatever you have to to retrieve it. - That's why I called you.
- Chain of command; remember? - Call NSA systems people. Get them on it.

- Chain of command; remember? - Call NSA systems people. Get them on it.
- I already did; George. - Good.
When are you coming back here?
- Just got off the phone with Jack Bauer. - Where is he?
On his way to see Wald. He wanted Mason to know.
Well; Mason's checked out. Just get the information directly to NSA.
And he asked about his daughter; Kim.
- Oh... Oh; no. - What?
- How long will she be under? - A few hours.
Then she stays here. Everything we have on this nuke has been destroyed.
All we have is the database Paula sent to the NSA and they didn't get the code.
We'll assign other IT people to retrieve it.
- She's the only one who can decrypt the files. - We'll send a programmer with her.
Yeah; I know.
- I thought Mason wasn't even coming back. - He's back.
He's trying to revive Paula long enough to access the information she was sending NSA.
So he's just gonna let her die?
I'm not so sure Mason made the wrong call.
We'll coordinate with Caltrans and Ventura sheriffs to set up watch points.
I want every resource on this. Edgar; lead satellite positioning.
Sarah; you'll coordinate with NSA. That's all. Thank you.
Chloe.
I'm sorry about Andrew. They said there's a good chance that he'll pull through.
Yeah. That's about it; right?
Thanks.
I just checked all the N.S.A. Logs.
There's no satellites going through the area we think Jack's in.
I'll check the flight paths just in case.
- And after what you've been through today; I don't see... - I just said; "I'm fine!"
All right? End of discussion; please.
Tony. I've got something. The N.S.A.'s got a satellite we may be able to reposition.
We just have to ask for access.
- All right. Thanks. - Yeah.
We can only assume that that's when Marwan grabbed Jack.
Chatter?
I filtered through everything from Langley; NSA and Interpol.
- None of it's correlating. - Volume?
It's actually slowing down; which may mean we've incurred all the damage we will today.
Call me when you do.
- Mr Buchanan; you need to listen to this. - What?
NSA intercepted a stream of chatter. Part of it's an audio recording.
They've identified one of the voices as belonging to Fayed.
(McCarthy) I've found someone to program the trigger codes on your bombs.
Thanks.
- Buchanan. - Did Chloe pull anything off the hard drives?
She came up empty; but the NSA picked up a conversation between McCarthy and Fayed.
McCarthy's found another engineer to arm the four remaining nukes.
- He's delivering him within the hour. - The nukes will be operational in 45 minutes?
CTU"; "New Orleans. Watson speaking.
This is Jack Bauer in Los Angeles.
You've a floating NSA operative in your region. His name is Robert Ellis.
Something terrible has happened.
What do you want us to do?
- Roger Stanton isn't available. - When can I talk to him?
That's all I can say; Rich.
If you have a tactical question; talk to Scott Grant. He's got the NSA playbook.
- I can use your name? - Sure.
Mike. Can I just have a quick word with you; please?
I want two transport teams assigned to each one. Pick 'em up now.
OK.
Hey; guys; heads up. They just received a second confirmation from NSA in Oregon.
The location of the bomb is indeed Norton Airfield.
Jack Bauer's en route. I want every available field agent over there now.
For now; I'd like you to treat the origin of this warrant as confidential.
- Understood; sir. - Good.
Put out an alert on Jack Bauer to all federal law-enforcement agencies and NSA.
1.1 I also tel I M i I italy. They have more men on the street.
I don't like this.
The train derailment; my abduction; the sabotage of our nuclear power plants.
Does evidence suggest he is planning more attacks?
I'm afraid so. NSA is reporting a spike in chatter. They're sifting through the intel now;
trying to determine potential targets and time frames.
- Trying is not good enough. - " The chopper is about to land.
And we're deploying Patriot missile batteries
at Cambridge Naval Tracking Station
and the NSA depot at Emery.
Do we have a problem; Admiral?
Sir; our KH-12 satellites are tracking
I get really nut burgers over this homeland security stuff.
Always check with me first;lemon.
- I have nsa connections. - Good.
Didn't you just get a haircut two days ago?
I get my haircut every two days.
Ours aren't the only ones up there.
Well; the only other satellites in the vicinity that could have ...
The NSA. You want to hack the NSA?
That's a bad idea; Skye.
That's a terrible idea.
That's a bad idea; Skye.
That's a terrible idea.
The NSA's already got S.H.I.E.L.D. on its watch list.
Why poke the bear ... the big; scary; waterboarding bear?
Ohh! I thought you were a comms agent;
grab his shield; head into battle?
Okay? Who's he supposed to battle?
If we hack NSA satellites;
we can get footage from the Fridge breakout;
see who was there; where they went.
see who was there; where they went.
Well; she's right. It's worth trying.
You know; I can't hack the NSA;
but maybe I can upload the hard drive you gave me;
get the specs on the weapons they might be carrying.
Let's live dangerously.
- Yeah! - How long before you get visuals?
Uh... NSA satellites should be tough.
- Give me an hour. - Great.
This is exciting.
Oh! Hey.
Believe it or not; Skye got us in!
We have access to the NSA's complete sat-feed history!
That girl's good.
I can see why you like her.
Eric?
You did it.
Koenig said you managed to hack the NSA.
Yeah; it looks that way. Where did he go?
He's sending everything over to NATO; CIA; Interpol.
Woman: Yeah; it went as expected.
S.H.I.E.L.D. implodes; and everyone wants answers.
The CIA; NSA; NRO ... them I can handle.
But Congress? Congress is like kindergarten.
Where is this Fridge?" "What was in there?
Oh. Well; that's...
not as sweet.
The NSA deciphered all the codes in these books;
but Irina's former resident chief just asked for them back;
which means there's something in here the NSA overlooked. Find it.
The NSA deciphered all the codes in these books;
but Irina's former resident chief just asked for them back;
which means there's something in here the NSA overlooked. Find it.
It's not a novel concept.
Trust me; somewhere in America;
I fail to see the relevance.
Right. Sorry.
So did the NSA.
Anyway; I ran a chromatographic analysis of the ink;
and check this out.
She works for Russian Intelligence.
I know.
Six years ago; the NSA recruited me.
They told me I was a target.
They had intel that I was gonna be approached.
They told me I was a target.
They had intel that I was gonna be approached.
You're NSA?
They recruited me out of Caltech;
even though; if you ask them;
and I would rather it be from me.
10 days ago; the Valta computer was stolen in broad daylight
as it was being transferred to NSA headquarters.
Now; the Valta represents cutting-edge technology.
It will revolutionize information gathering from satellite networks.
I'll see you when you're through.
Okay.
Great. I'll check that out with the NSA.
Intel indicates Bishop owns a dozen industrial properties in Spain.
Any one of them could be a safe hiding place for the Valta.
I have a meeting with someone who can help us re-acquire
the Di Regno heart.
He'll get us plans to the NSA facility
where they keep the Rambaldi artifacts.
In the meantime;
Finding Tippin is your priority.
How did it go?
The NSA facility uses
state-of-the-art Iocking mechanisms.
We've bypassed systems Iike that before.
The access codes I downloaded from the CIA Echelon system
won't work anymore.
The NSA now uses a time-synchronized key card.
Presumably a CIA agent under the proper duress
could obtain such a key card.
He's at large.
And believed to have escaped.
Which should provide us leverage to get into the NSA.
If we recover the evidence in Marseilles before Sydney;
we can force her hand.
14...
Agent Bristow; I'm pulling rank.
Agent Vaughn; this is NSA Deputy Director Brandon.
I am ordering you
to take that shot at first possible opportunity.
If I don't see you again; Mr. Sark;
tell Irina that I hope you both succeed where I couldn't.
This is Frederick Brandon; NSA Deputy Director.
He's coordinating a task force
to Iocate and study Rambaldi's work.
Until the moment specified by Rambaldi has come and gone;
by national security directive;
this operation center is under the jurisdiction of NSA.
[ Thud ]

I am ordering you.

Phone calls; E-mails; faxes from around the world
are filtered through a program capable of flagging words
on an N.S.A. list.
Echelon has been immeasurably successful
in indicating threats to our national security.
were raided by Indian authority last week.
My dealings with Mr. Cuvee go back several years.
He showed me an Echelon terminal he stole from the N.S.A.
that he keeps at a front company in Paris.
Attention by local authorities led Cuvee to believe
Tell me you have something.
But whoever screwed with these files used a version of DOD's encryption algorithm.
I hacked into NSA's network and pulled the decryption key.
- What did you find? - Your fugitive used a handful of aliases;
one of which passed through Italian customs last night.
Sydney was right. The Medusa project was flagged in the SD-6 database.
It‚Äôs an anti-satellite pulse weapon. Once operational;
it can cripple our network of satellites; DOD; NSA; you name it.
We‚Äôd be blind to a potential attack.
You see; that‚Äôs what‚Äôs so genius about this weapon‚Ä¶
or Vaughn.
That‚Äôs what makes it so difficult.
We just got intel from NSA.
They tracked Sark onto a plane from Berlin;
headed to Frankfurt; only when it landed; he wasn‚Äôt on board.
- You okay? - Yeah. Thanks.
This is not a power play.
The facility we're headed for; security's tighter than the NSA.
If I don't have the right equipment; it's pointless.
We should move.
I'm on my way.
But I worked for the C.I.A.;
the N.S.A. Why would he need to lie?
You have to understand; Carrie; he was ordered not to tell you.
We all were.
When he or she takes a drink of water or a shower;
the water would permeate to the system.
I'll instruct the NSA to add every derivatlon
of "genetics" to the Echelon watch llst.
Uh; excuse me one second.
All right; I'll put in a call to euro control; see if we can track it.
I think I might be able to triangulate
Dixon's signal using one of NSA's comm sats. Just...
Excuse me; do you have a minute?
What is this about?
Those books your father bought your mother;
the ones he had imported 25 years ago.
Those Cyrillic codes you found and gave to me. I had NSA look at them.
- Yeah? - Yeah.
- What is this? - Directives.
I never...
want to see you again.
I'll need taps into all gov networks. NSA; DOD; FBI; CIA.
I'll need a red phone to the PreSldent.
-No. -I just thought I'd ask.
National Security matter. Need to know.
National Security? What are you? ClA? FBl?
NSA?
Doesn't matter; George; l've dealt with these guys...
and the ones that don't talk are up to no good.
I said stand down; damn it. D.O.D.
NSA!
NSA? What the hell you guys doing here?
What a mess. I gotta get out there.
Wait. Hold on.
This ringing in my ear just won't stop.
Well; Sullivan's got it worse than you do;
and now she's at the NSA dealing with
this bureaucratic meltdown.
I don't envy her.
And hurry!
What am I looking at?
Turns out Skylar was working for the NSA
on various classified projects;
meanwhile sending encrypted messages back and forth
Z? Nathan; I'm not a cryptologist.
I can't read this.
Neither could the NSA. Couldn't break the code.
The Agent I spoke with said they'd never run into
an algorithm this complex.
So you came all this way just to raid my apartment.
Not exactly.
So officially; this is a joint operation with the NSA;
but truth be told--
It's more like finders keepers; huh?
Seemed like a fun project at the time;
but lately; he hasn't been playing for the right team.
Well; if the NSA has been following your every move;
then how come they don't know where you are right now?
Processing lag.
or he gets in contact with you at all.
Thank you.
According to my NSA contact;
this machine could track down anyone on Earth.
And if coordinated with a predator drone...
I knew; eventually; people would come after her.
Like they did with you.
If the NSA found out about Zoe;
do you think they'd let me keep her?
They'd turn her into a lab rat or worse.
Every number Parish called; every number that called him.
It's encrypted.
Tight as hell; but NSA's been working overtime
to decode it.
They could have something solid on his inside source
I made 200.
This is what Cley got off Parish's phone.
The NSA is still working on it;
but I cracked it.
You didn't even ask me to; but I cracked it anyway.
I know that look; Lee.
Don't worry. I'm all over this.
Got the NSA to triple their manpower
on the investigation.
You came by house
Nothing for two weeks.
No; I haven't heard from him.
Shoulda never let Cley assign Gary to the N.S.A.
Yeah; well; it's not like we had a choice.
Look; I'll rattle their cage;
ten days ago.
And you just found out about this?
N.S.A. won't tell you what color the sky is
without formal approval.
We warned you about this when you sent him over there.
Nina; Gary's in trouble. He needs us.
Gary; I should have never let Cley
loan you out to the N.S.A.
I know that now.
I just thought I needed to do whatever it took
You're the bastard.
You're right.
You left me with N.S.A.
And they made me spy on my friends.
And then--and then; they wouldn't answer
That's 29 people in the hospital
and 5 in the morgue.
NSA says this isn't one of their usual suspects.
Doesn't look natural.
So does this look like an Alpha or not?
Skylar...
This is important.
I took a tremendous risk helping you elude the NSA.
I did not have to do that.
Really?
She was being shadowed by another entity;
and whoever it is; they're good.
NSA good.
But; as you know;
I'm good; too.
I used credit card receipts; compiled a list
of customers last night; pinged all their cell phones
and hacked into their photos. The NSA is right;
it's a lot easier when you don't need a warrant.
I eyeballed every photo. There must have been thousands.
through every conceivable law enforcement database.
He's made a series of calls to an Alberto Garcia.
Huh. According to NSA;
Garcia's a reputed underworld talent scout.
He books all the Deadshot's hits.
Oliver! No offense.
Do I tell you how to sharpen your arrows?
Spoke to my friend at the NSA.
The website code matches a cyber crusader who's been on their radar.
He hacks into fringe sites under the user name "The Savior."
The website code matches a cyber crusader who's been on their radar.
He hacks into fringe sites under the user name "The Savior."
NSA believes he's a former resident of the Glades.
Former? Yeah; well; a year ago;
he hacked himself right off the radar.
I just thought I'd...
I'm cross referencing Walczak's known associates
with decryption experts on the NSA watch list;
but it's taking some time.
Which we don't have.
I still have to ask you a few questions.
Why isn't this working? It is.
It's running an nsa algorithm aggregating
The victims' personal information using
Every government database known; and unknown.
What'd you find?
Merlyn Global's cyber security is off the charts.
Firewalls; NSA-grade I.P.Sec protocols...
What's that; tech speak for "I struck out; boss."
Yeah; but I wasn't the only one.
aah!
Ohh!
Special agent Bennett. NSA.
The synthoid is ours.
Now; either help or get out of the way.
I don't think they know about the picnic;
but see why I don't trust Gabe?
He's worse than the NSA.
Okay; Houston; Houston.
Let me see if I can get anything that will help out of the NSA
He's worse than the NSA.
Okay; Houston; Houston.
Let me see if I can get anything that will help out of the NSA
before we ditch 'em. I'm back.
Houston and Broadway. Where is he?
You're under arrest.
If you're hoping to get classified names or something;
it's encrypted; NSA level.
These people are above the law!
What people? Who are they?
What is taking so long?
Are you kidding?
This is NSA-level decryption.
It's amazing I got anything at all so far.
Okay; get over yourself; JT. We need names; all right?
Because if you were hoping
to get classified names or something; forget it.
It's encrypted; NSA level. I know.
And we have it and you don't.
Mm-hmm.
Or Lisslow was lying and he acted alone. It's possible.
I vetted Lisslow myself.
IAFIs; NSA; Interpol; he came up clean.
None of this makes a lick of sense.
[Phone ringing]
Hey; can I get something to drink?
Yeah; I'll get you a drink.
Anything on the NSA feed?
Increased chatter; but nothing seems to relate.
Can you put up the original e-mail intercept?
Angela Merkel's cell phone.
What?
The NSA tapped the German chancellor's private cell phone.
I'm sure they had their good reasons for it;
but I'm also sure you can't find anyone outside the NSA
The NSA tapped the German chancellor's private cell phone.
I'm sure they had their good reasons for it;
but I'm also sure you can't find anyone outside the NSA
who thinks it's a good policy.
This is not that.
all eyes are on your ILP.
This is the Snowden era.
Hell; even the NSA
let 60 Minutes in their front door.
Maybe; but they didn't let 'em in the kitchen
It's probably why I never opened up around here.
Wow; nine.
Or it could have been my stint in the NSA.
Yeah; they never allowed us
to talk about anything there.
Yeah; they never allowed us
to talk about anything there.
You were in the NSA?
Mm-hmm; summer job.
Yeah; when I was deciding what I wanted to do.
bizarre but splendid parents.
Thanks; Clark.
So about you and the NSA...
Never going to happen; Dr. Hodgins.
Yeah; but... It was just a summer job.
Good night; Clark. Night.
It's totally weird; right?
And he was in the NSA;
so he could be completely messing with us.
Or he's just turning into a normal guy.
I heard you tried to get Hodgins interested in doing an experiment.
Let's just say I planted the seed.
What? CIA? NSA?
No. Dupont Circle.
Special Agent Booth;FBI.
Why?
I ran the missing persons report
through an NSA voice analyzer program; and...
My friend is missing.
His name is Symchay Conteh.
Everyone!
Everyone; this is officer Jason Bly of the css.
It is a branch of the NSA;
Performing covert intelligence Support for the military.
All right; that's enough. You think so?
who burned me recently.
he seemed unhappy.
this is not about one nsa officer
who acted on information in a file.
this is a departmental review in which I...
fits right here on the back of the receipt.
I'll read it for you.
"He works counterintel for the nsa." that's it.
That's all I got.
Is there any way to reach him?
That's all I got.
Is there any way to reach him?
Mike;you know these nsa guys. They're like ghosts.
They got no phone number;no address;no nothing.
Sorry I couldn't be more help.
What do you want?
I'm trying to reach out to the man who burned me...
Nsa officer philip cowan.
I just need you to mention him as a friend of yours
when you know the americans are listening.
They're all over the continent.
Where'd you get the files?
Some guy from the NSA.
The NSA has a leak? I want a name.
I don't know it! He used a cut-out!
Where'd you get the files?
Some guy from the NSA.
The NSA has a leak? I want a name.
I don't know it! He used a cut-out!
We didn't become Facebook buddies!
We didn't become Facebook buddies!
Forget about getting off this island.
Without those files; we don't know who the NSA leak is
or which outposts the mercs are targeting.
A lot of our people get killed if we don't get them back.
Son of a bitch.
How's that for something you can feel; Mr. Vanderwall?
Get these to the top brass at the NSA.
Shouldn't be hard for them to find their leak.
Anybody ever tell you your brand of espionage is hell on the nerves?
Still haven't found her brother?
Yeah; I'm all buddied out; Mike --
I mean; FBI; NSA; Interpol.
The whereabouts of Mr. Trent Lang
are a mystery to us all.
We checked out all the top satellite experts in Miami.
I think we hit the jackpot.
That's Max Lyster. Contracts for the NSA; mostly.
But get this.
A few months ago; he took a leave from his firm
I'm trying; sir; but it looks like every call in the state
is being routed through that tower; I can't just--
Get the NSA on it; then. Get me on that call!
Let me guess. You're changing the venue.
There's a car waiting at the corner of Collins and 7th.
Yes.
Mom?
My mom would have been a great nsa communications operative.
How did you get this number?
That's how you greet your mother?
I got a call this morning from a spencer watkowski.
You've seen him. he waters plants at the office.
He's ex-nsa. he's a real heavy hitter.
That's impossible.
The guy -- he's a nut. he's way off.
You ready to end this?
Believe me; I'm ready.
I just got off the phone with the NSA encryption team.
The data you ripped from Sonya's phone
was a gold mine.
which means you can see the passing cars.
I pulled the footage from after Max was shot --
image wasn't great; but NSA helped me clean it up.
Check it out.
I can explain.
I got it. But if she's any good;
she's gonna be bouncing her signal all over the globe.
I'd have to rope in half a dozen of N.S.A.'s finest
to track her down. It's worth it.
She's gonna hurt a lot of innocent people.
She's gonna hurt a lot of innocent people.
Yeah? I'm innocent people.
If I get busted using N.S.A. resources
to help a burned spy with an unapproved mission;
they'll ship me off to Siberia;
So; are you done thinking?
Here's the deal.
When the N.S.A. gives me an address on this hacker lady;
Michael Westen;
soon-to-be-reinstated agent of the CIA;
Michael; I'm not sure
we're gonna be able to pull this off.
Anson's using a radio the NSA itself can't crack.
I don't want to just give up.
Well; I'm not giving up.
There was a rumor about a deep-cover Russian mole
working around Arlington.
She turned the N.S.A. inside out.
Yeah; and the information she sent home
got a lot of good agents killed.
That doesn't mean the network can't be hacked.
Our server's protected by a firewall
the N.S.A. couldn't crack.
What about someone from the inside?
Where do all their data lines go?
Well; I might be able to help out with that.
How's that? With moisturizer?
Remember that NSA logistics guy who got caught up in the Panamanian banking scandal a couple years back?
Rings a bell.
Should have ended his career.
What do you think this is about; huh?
It smells like an intelligence op.
CIA; NSA; DHS?
Same letters; different alphabet.
I had some buddies from the service
Except she was the only one who knew what it meant.
I gave it to contacts
in the NSA; the FBI; Military Intelligence.
No one was able to decipher it.
This is the day she died.
Sorry to disappoint; Mr. Castle;
but it's a human perp we're after.
NSA picked up an encrypted signal
that was sent out the exact moment the pilot lost control.
That signal basically overrode the controls
And where did this signal come from?
From the lower half of the State of New York.
Uh; NSA is trying to narrow that down as we speak.
So for all we know; we're looking for
some 14-year-old nerd with a computer?
Well; now we know why our victim doesn't exist.
He's a spy.
We contacted the CIA; the FBI; the NSA and Homeland Security.
So far; all of them are denying that he was one of theirs.
Well; of course they're gonna deny it.
Bon app√É¬©tit.
- So anything? - Actually; yes.
We got a hit from the calls we got a voice match; and we're giving it to NSA.
We also got a trace from our cell tower in Paris.
You got an address?
The French have already filed a formal complaint.
Of course they have.
Michael: I want to check out the NSA address;
but first we need to shake our tail.
I just want to know who let them know we were coming.
All right; should be right here on the left.
Unbelievable.
NSA can pinpoint it right to the apartment.
We have satellites that can tell
if the part in your hair is crooked.
This is fantastic.
Have we shared all this with the French?
Yes. And we have the NSA figuring out coordinates.
Sharing intel with our allies; working together.
We can have a tactical victory
main headquarters; Washington; D.C.;
privately funded; last year posting a $10 billion profit.
They have in their employ ex-NSA; CIA;
KGB; Iranian secret police;
South African Secret Service; and Saudi Intelligence;
the way we think they will. When I was 20;
I had a basketball scholarship to M.I.T.
I was gonna graduate and work for the NSA
and change the world.
What happened?
Okay; let's go; let's go!
They put my father in the hospital. They took his mind.
- Who do you think they are? - NSA; CIA; who knows?
Somebody in bulletproof vests. The question is; who are you?
Friends.
You.
This program I built will cross-reference
NSA; FBI; CIA; and DHS databases.
Adres "Pulpo" Dias.
There are several phones I can link to him.
Excuse me for a moment.
Who are you people?
NSA.
- Stay right there. Let us do our job. - Your job?
- Do you have any idea who I am? - Open it.
I need a badge and a signature.

He blew up three U.S. embassies in Africa last week.
I'm putting out an interdepartmental call
to CIA; NSA and FBI.
This could be the most important piece
of U.S. Intelligence work in the last three months.

(sirens wailing)
Colonel John Casey.
NSA.
The behavior you two displayed with your wedding planner
...was unprofessional and unacceptable.
So who do you work for?
Is it the FBI?
CIA? NSA?
I; you know; I can't discuss the particulars.
Okay.
is in danger.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
The nsa sent their top agent to protect me.
That's casey. He's pretty scary.
He works at buy more now;cas aover.
She'll deliver chuck to the rendezvous tonight.
Good. Dr. Zarnow's on his way to L.A. Now.
He is our best;nsa's top scientist.
Well;I hope he can fix this.
Get in.
Tell me what this is.
A... a nasty...
nsa incinerator.
Special issue designed toeliminate all biological traces.
That's what killed the doctor.
No;no;no;why should I believe you?
She showed me the bomb. She saidyou did it.
Nsa incinerator;right?
It's a niceexplosive easily purchasedon the black market.
What do you really knowabout sarah;chuck;huh?
Well;it's not me. Is it yours?
no.
nsa incinerator! Run!
casey! Casey!
You're nervouscooking;babe. Relax.
Special issue designed toeliminate all biological traces.
That's what killed the doctor.
And guess who worksfor the nsa?
-Why... why;why would casey... - he's a killer;chuck.
It's what he doesfor a living.
No;no;no;why should I believe you?
She showed me the bomb. She saidyou did it.
Nsa incinerator;right?
It's a niceexplosive easily purchasedon the black market.
What do you really knowabout sarah;chuck;huh?
Well;it's not me. Is it yours?
no.
nsa incinerator! Run!
casey! Casey!
You're nervouscooking;babe. Relax.
You know what? I'mcrashing the party. Maybe I should...I'll get it.
Strange.
nsa ran a checkon sarah walker to see what we had... two years ago;she posedas a french diplomat.
Infiltrated the innercircle of an arms deal.
Killed the entire circle.
Just relax.
Hello; John Casey.
NSA assassin.
Who are you?
The man who's going to kill you.
I suppose I could explain our overarching goals...
but this might tax the brain
of an aging NSA agent.
Let's just say the Ring wishes to preserve
Costa Gravas' status quo.
I would trust Dragan with my life.
You; on the other hand; John Casey;
NSA agent;
not so much.
What exactly was your plan...
Well; I got to run. Thanks again.
You go to work; i'll get the diamond.
- What? - NSA magic.
I put a trace on her phone.
Wherever she's going; I'm going.
To settle an old score.
Okay; just give me 20 seconds. Are you sure about this?
NSA picked up the Director's signal.
This is his broadcast point.
If they're right; Sarah;
BECKMAN: Is this Morgan Grimes?
Yeah. Who dis?
This is General Beckman of the NSA.
I am calling to say...
that you are officially a member of Operation Bartowski.
so we let you do that for us
when you warned them to leave the theater;
so on behalf of the NSA;
the CIA; and of course your local Buy More;
I'd just like to say thanks a lot.
WOMAN: Bryce Larkin was CIA; Graham.
He was one of your agents.
GRAHAM: And it was NSA's job to find him
No; you got a dead CIA agent.
It's a gold star in my book.
Well; this computer did everything.
After 9/11;
the NSA and the CIA were told to play nice--
Every scrap of data we had went into this computer.
It mined for patterns in the chatter.
But what if he has an external drive? A backup?
It's over; Sarah.
The NSA is stepping in.
Bryce was CIA; he was our guy; and he burned us.
Casey's on his way out.
I really don't date all that much.
Chuck Bartowski's your mark.
NSA director wants him with a pulse.
Till we find out who he's working with
CIA skirt... you can kill.
Computer emergency.
Listen to me; Chuck. Those men will hurt you.
They're from the NSA and they're after you.
Me? Why; why?
Why me? I'm nobody.
It's late. I'm tired.
Let's cut the crap and give him to me now.
He belongs to the NSA.
(gasps) The CIA gets him first.
You come any closer and I shoot.
at the Large Mart today.
That's kinof odd; wouldn't you say?
Look; last week the NSA;
blueprints of a hotel; that hotel.
And then the CIA; you guys found a file
Is it straight? Does it look good?
What are we going to do?
Relax; chuck. These are nsa cleaners.
They'll have the buy more back to normal in a jiffy.
Chuck: what's happening with bryce?
Hi. I'm Chuck. Here's a few things
that you might need to know.
This is General Beckman of the NSA.
I am calling to say...
That you are officially a member of Operation Bartowski.
Um; excuse me; I've got to go to the loo.
CASEY: Seal the room; seal the room!
Ladies and gentlemen; this is an NSA emergency.
No one-- I repeat; no one-- gets in or out.
(cell phone ringing) Sorry; sorry.
Oh! O-Okay; okay.
Okay; see th-the thing is I-I kind of sort of work
for the CIA and the NSA in my off hours
when I'm not working at the store.
It's kind of like a second job for me.
Believe me;I know.
And that's Casey.
He works for the NSA.
He's not as pretty.
Let the geek go!
WORLD SEND Our transporters will be taking the Cipher out of Los Angeles.
General; what exactly is the Cipher?
I mean; mercenaries break into the NSA lab;
and it's the only thing they take?
The Cipher is the artificial brain
It's a ring communication device; general.
Exactly. It works off a closed network;
But the nsa has recently developed
New technology to crack it.
Now we can put it into use.
Whoa; slow down; tiger.
I told you I wasn't a nice guy.
Okay; hands up! NSA.
It'll be okay; ma'am.
Step off the elevator with your baby.
all the cool kids go.
GLA also conducts
top secret research for the NSA.
Most of our surveillance and weapons tracking technology is developed there.
We picked up intel that someone might try to penetrate
Sensei?
GO!
NSA TACTICAL INSTRUCTOR TY BENNETT
Oh; no.
Hey; did you get a good look at him?
You always do.
Uh; p.m.
NSA Agent John Casey in his apartment;
speaking to an elderly gentleman.
And I detect a hint of Midwestern...
We've unsealed his file and this is what we've learned.
Alex Coburn faked his death in Honduras
was recruited for NSA Black Ops
by a Colonel James Keller.
Keller must've recruited him again
That is John Casey.
Of course; yeah; you know that he works here.
Why? He's an NSA agent;
and if the Intersect project was disbanded;
why would he...?
there are some very bad people looking for him;
including a man named John Casey.
He's an NSA double agent.
He's been monitoring you for another organization.
John Casey works with my brother.
who works at the Buy More.
That's me; you idiot!
I'm NSA.
Sarah Walker; Chuck Bartowski; they're CIA.
They are so not.
Oh; yeah; good.
Hey.
NSA just picked up a purchase
on Jill's credit card.
Two tickets to some stupid concert
I'm ready!
Chuck; Casey.
NSA monitored a call from Burbank
to Augusto Gaez yesterday.
Gaez knows the Cats are coming.
so I can go back to my old life
and have a chance at a real relationship.
Do you really think the NSA and the CIA
are going to be cool with that?
You should have trusted me.
Major. If I could just...
We can't take that risk.
My NSA technicians will inspect the computer.
Sarah; please.
I'm-I'm sorry; Chuck.
First; you and I need to work something out on our own.
I don't understand.
You see; FULCRUM knows John Casey's NSA.
The person he called is in the Buy More right now.
The yogurt girl's CIA.
Okay. Man; I'm going to have a headache tomorrow.
Ilsa Trinchina.
AP photographer; rumored lover of undercover NSA agent.
Whereabouts unknown.
Sugar Bear?
Morgan; the-the truth is...
The truth is... I am a member
of a joint NSA-CIA black ops team
that is stationed here in Burbank.
I have a level six clearance;
But Chuck believes her.
Yeah.
I know a decommissioned NSA agent; specializes
in expunged documents.
Unsavory character; but I think he can
And they have nothing to do with your mission.
Tonight; there was supposed to be a joint
CIA/NSA/INTERPOL bust; Alexei Volkoff's
three most trusted lieutenants.
We tracked them down through his Hydra Network;
I see your true potential.
You started working
for the NSA because you were America's best sharpshooter.
And now...
you're so much more than this; Colonel.
Oh;that's very nice...
how did you know my size?
Nsa-- they have records of your rental information from prom night.
I checked the suit in your closet.
Okay;this is my first foray into major undercover spy work;
Oh; yeah.
Payne: yes? Who is it?
The NSA; CIA and me; who's a little tougher to explain; but...
We all have our skill set.
Sarah: freeze.
¬±¬æ√ó√ñ√Ñ¬ª¬Ω√∂¬π¬©√ë¬ß√è¬∞¬Ω¬ª√Å√∑¬£¬¨√ë√è¬Ω√ª√ì√É√ì√ö√â√å√í¬µ√ì√É√ç¬æ
So you don't know why I'm in the Intersect.
Well; you didn't appear on the NSA radar
until after Bryce sent you the Intersect.
Same with the CIA.
It won't be easy.
New intel suggests the professor is being hunted.
The NSA interviewed one witness in Fleming's class who ID'd
a Magnus Einersson. He's an Icelandic spy.
I'm sorry.
I- I appreciate the tour and all...
It's no longer simply a retail store.
It's now a full-fledged CIA-NSA substation.
We can patch into
security cameras all over the world.
They were never gonna let me go;
even if we found your dad; would they?
NSA; FULCRUM; CIA-- They're all the same.
They all lie.
They're not gonna let you go either; Chuck.
Hi; I'm Chuck. Here are a few things that you might need to know.
We spared no expense recreating the Buy More.
It's now a full-fledged CIA-NSA substation.
I'm pregnant.
Oh; my God; oh; my God.
you might need to know; maybe you just forgot.
We spared no expense re-creating the Buy More.
It's now a full-fledged CIA-NSA substation.
New Buy More? Rules.
Slides. Doors.
Wow.That's very romantic.
Why don't you just club her over the head and drag her out by her foot?
Look;i'll handle this one without the nsa;thank you.
You did a good job last night.
We're going down to the docks a few hours to intercept the package.
Let's go.
Honey; you can flash all the badges you want at me.
CIA; NSA; FBI.
The answer's no.
Important to speak to him
I said he was wearing a nice tie.
He was the toast of the room last night--he and his wife.
You have to pick up the N.S.A. In 20 minutes.
Yeah.
It's going to be a challenging day for our president.
they have the president's orders.
I haven't heard her change them.
N.S.A. Reports intercepting new commands to the korean warships.
They're being told to give our rescue operation a 1-kilometer working area.
Getting reports from field recon.
Fortunately;right now it looks like they have no idea we're there.
The C.I.A. Says there's nothing on north korean media;
and the N.S.A. Reports no increase in chatter on the military channels.
If they find out; they'll throw a fit.
they'll throw worse than that.
Sounds like an inside job.
Company swears no.
They vet their people tighter than the NSA.
Everyone has been accounted for.
Alright.
Section Six.
An organization apparently backed by the US Government.
Yet neither the FBI or the NSA have ever heard of it.
- How does that work? - That's need to know.
Inspector Dillon accepted your credentials because you are effective.
How did he know about the facility?
Was he CIA?
NSA?
I don't know. I don't--
I can't help Oksana if I can't identify him.
Is pretty sharp.
If you type the word "nuclear" into an email;
The nsa's all over it.
But this spy has gone analog in a digital world.
Aren't there computers that can handle this sort of thing?
Let's face it. Anyone else would have
made a play for the corner office by now;
or gone over to the NSA.
To get a better office and a parking space to go with it?
I stayed because I assumed my responsibilities would expand.
√¢‚Ñ¢¬™ it's just something that I've done √¢‚Ñ¢¬™
√¢‚Ñ¢¬™ I never meant to show you my mistakes √¢‚Ñ¢¬™
This was an NSA listening post.
Amazing what lengths our paranoia took us.
Speaking of which; are you sure you weren't followed?
Wilson is a senior-level analyst
with the National Security Agency.
Your postman is NSA.
How'd you get this?
He's taking some big risks right now
And you should be too.
Wilson did time with the special collections services.
That's NSA black-bag shit.
Start chasing him; he'll come after you.
Okay; let's unpack this a bit.
to Borz Altan.
Harris Wilson.
He's NSA; Upper level management.
He's in charge of the Midwest trunk.
Gives him access to a dozen CIA facilities.
- Could we speak privately? - Yes; of course.
You need me to do what?
We need you to call your friend at the NSA
and have him call Wilson into the office.
Why?
So Flint is a legitimate government black Ops team?
It looks that way.
I had another friend at NSA
who was able to produce a physical address
from that a fax line.
Wait. You're not coming with me?
I'm not going in there if I don't have to.
Nsa is sending over the files you requested;
And annie walker is here.
Annie walker. Great to meet you.
Has gotta call to get you released.
The operative word being released.
So what did the nsa come up with?
Well; they ran the wiretaps on miss calhoun from oversight.
- And? - And; um...
two qualities that fit the treasonous profile.
We need to get him under surveillance.
That's N.S.A. purview.
We'll get Joan to liaise with Fort Meade.
No.
No.
No way. Absolutely not.
A wiretap means we're in bed with N.S.A.
And they would control the legacy switch.
Sorry.
could get around the legacy switch.
Supersede the rule of law?
Destroy our tenuous relationship with justice and the N.S.A.?
If you'll let me just finish--
No.
that was going on in their house.
We'd maintain jurisdiction over the investigation;
and we wouldn't have to interface with N.S.A.
That'll work.
How should we get inside their house?
it's because I've been eavesdropping on your husband.
Why would you be eavesdropping on Arthur?
Well; you know the N.S.A. is part of the task force
investigating Jai's murder; right?
- I assumed it would be. - Yeah; well; I've been
Do you think she was involved?
Maybe. Maybe not.
Auggie; you need to get one of your NSA buddies to tag
phone locator records for; so we can get a call history.
Okay. I'll do it; but; Joan?
All right.
But let me tell you what happens if you do.
I'd be forced to call the FBI; the NSA; and the DNI's office.
That's what I'm supposed to do when I discover
a drive containing stolen classified intel
We just received some time-sensitive intel
about Ivan Kravec.
N.S.A. provided us with data from their MYSTIC program;
analyzing every cell phone call made out of Paris last week.
Looks like Kravec is gearing up for some sort of big meeting;
State-of-the-art microchips used in nuclear centrifuges;
missile guidance systems; telecomm.
D.I.A.; N.S.A.; FBI-- they're all staking claims.
Could be a coincidence; but if this thing is real;
every agency in the alphabet soup
Okay. And you're gonna take 'em both down?
Yeah. And it's not just us.
There's N.S.A.; D.I.A.; D.H.S.
They're all involved. It's a veritable party.
And seeing as your information helped us put it together;
Don't hurt her.
Ask who they work for.
No; ask if they're NSA.
No; ask--
They're FBI; aren't they?
I'll have a prayer rug and water bowl sent in.
What the heck is going on here ?
The NSA is routing all messages to us for language analysis.
You know; rumor has it; much to my chagrin;
that during national security emergencies;
No; I have a job interview.
Hey; rock star; you up for that systems promotion?
No; no. A friend of mine is a headhunter for the NSA.
Uh; they're looking for analysts versed in cyber warfare.
Really? That sounds exciting.
We have updated footage of that disaster.
What have you got; Garcia?
Ok; guess what. I borrowed a page from the NSA playbook
and I ran everyone on that plane's text and emails
from the past week against icky keywords;
We didn't think to get any.
Not a problem.
I'll have our technical analyst get some from the nsa.
I'd like to see what the areas surrounding the highways are like.
First victims; fritz and johanna dietrich;
It's creatin' chaos all over the city.
That's consistent with a terrorist agenda.
All right; so put in a call to NSA.
See if there's been any reports of domestic terror activity.
These are the witness statements.
Did we get a location?
No.
REPORTER: The head of the NSA;
the head of the National Council of...
(door creaks)
Two; MP.
Marshall Plan.
Three; NSA.
National Security Agency.
National Security Act.
(laughter)
(laughter fading)
I'm requesting a transfer to NSA.
Approved.
I think I did it; Jo.
I make it a point not to fraternise with automatons.
They slow me down.
So what are you? FBI? NSA?
Let's just say that I've been sent to wipe out all evidence that Manticore ever existed
and leave it at that.
Soon enough.
We're closed. Come back tomorrow!
Special Agent Otto Gottlieb; NSA.
- I'd like to ask you a few questions. - Sorry; didn't realise that; uh...
I mean; you know; I never expected; uh...
Yeah; well; kids just mysteriously disappear there over the years...
...and they say it's the witches or whatever...
...but I think the CIA or the NSA had something to do with it.
It's just lik e our government to come up with some occult backstory...
... to cover up their malfeasance.
I'll be too busy rounding up our day-trippers to look under mattresses.
- That's my call. - Actually; it's mine.
You're NSA ?
Which outranks Rossum Private Security by more than a whole bunch.
Topher.
Say hi for me.
Nope; you dolls; you're...
By which; of course; I mean NSA; CDC folks;
you're safe as houses.
Because of the government. They do things.
you know what I'd do to someone who exposed us like that ?
I'd kill him.
- Who's our target ? - We found NSA tech in our equipment.
DeWitt's known they've been sniffing around the Dollhouse for years.
Getting access to their files is our best shot at finding the spy.
How long do you think you can keep this up ?
Excuse me ?
You work for the NSA.
You have a file that says she's the one.
Uh-huh.
There was a phone call made to the National Security Agency
after the lockdown.
You warned the NSA Sierra was coming
so that they could plant this file for her to find.
You wanted us to blame lvy so that you could continue to operate.
Funny; coming from the man who tried to kill her twice.
Why did you want to bring down the Dollhouse ?
What can the NSA do with it that we can't ?
I wasn't sent to bring you down.
I was sent to make sure you didn't bring yourself down.
Just like you believed in me and look how that played out.
You were wrong.
Get what you can out of him about the NSA;
and have Topher prep him for the Attic.
That's it; Miss DeWitt ?
arcane.
It's what he calls himself.
I was trapped inside the nsa.
It felt like years.
He came there to murder me.
and unlicensed experiments.
But that's all it is: anecdotal.
You have a source at the NSA?
Had. Like everyone else; he's gone to ground.
Well; you have their financials.
It was hand-delivered for Mr. Dominic today.
We haven't been able to unlock the data that's inside.
- You think it's from the NSA ? - We know he was their inside man.
With him suddenly off their radar;
this may be them reaching out; trying to find him.
Oh; I'm in the chair. Of course.
Mr. Dominic; please.
A communication has arrived for you from your handlers at the NSA;
and we're rather curious about it.
Whose hands are these ?
Then can I hold the gun ?
- Never saw it before. Come on.
It's from your best friends and handlers at the NSA.
No; it isn't.
We didn't communicate that way. We have phones.
What's it gonna be ?
I don't know. He never sent me anything before.
Whether it's from the NSA or from Alpha makes no difference.
It's intended that you should be able to open it;
therefore you should be able to open it.
The stuff you get for free...
are you expected to provide any additional services?
Nope. NSA... no strings attached.
Your witness.
You're not dumb; are you; Ms. Barrett?
Um; Alan; the government monitors Internet searches.
That's legal?
The NSA can collect data to counter the threat of terrorism.
So Susan was probably flagged as a terrorist
just based on the family's Internet search history.
So Susan was probably flagged as a terrorist
just based on the family's Internet search history.
See; the NSA might have assumed she was coding;
buying fertilizer; using yellow cake;
and to top it all off; she was sending e-mails to Saudi Arabia.
the C.E.O. said he would come right over.
Uh; I'm so sorry about your client.
The NSA can be overzealous in their surveillance activities.
We believe that Susan's arrest was based on search terms
used by multiple family members;
to... get this... national security.
So they were probably beta-testing the software
for the NSA when Susan got flagged.
Grabzilla wanted two weeks
to review our request for her search history.
That Alejandro was still alive.
Well; how'd you find that out?
NSA decrypted an e-mail he sent to Angie.
What did it say?
Basically; "Stop trying to dig up
Hello.
Major; it's Greg. I have that info.
It's that NSA dude-- Greg.
Put him on speaker.
What have you got for us; Greg?
We found Alejandro.
Fantastic.
How? JT: NSA picked up
a cell conversation he had with a contact in Caracas.
We're going to grab him at the airport.
Look; if I could find one shred of evidence
that Dima actually was dealing in bio-weapons;
but I talked to the NSA; DIA; FBI. Nobody has anything.
He So; what; you think Metcalfe's trying
to have our Russian friend sent
I believe they're calling it "resiliency ning.
You ever get any resiliency training bk in the day; sir?
What did NSA get for us?
They intercepted a call to Dima
from an American. Get out of town.
For example; if there's suspicion of involvement
in terrorism or WMD.
Get the necessary paperwork down to NSA.
What do you want?
You have my word;o make sure Mr. Dima.I'm not being follow
Get down.
- Secure that can! - Nothing came out.
- NSA has a match. - Thanks; Javed.
Mustaffeh was using SIM card from a batch that was stolen 3 weeks ago
and link to a known terrorist cell in London.
You've got a specific target in mind?
Seems like Ibrahim and Mustaffah playing some phone tag.
- NSA got a hit on a cellphone 5 hours ago. - Where?
cell tower of I-90; Buffalo; New York.
Kenny; pull the map.
Sir; SOD is validating requirement for a high-altitude electronic warfare aircraft;
codename Aurora over New York city.
We expect a SecDef chop and NSA approval ASAP.
The FAA will clear the air space to enable the collection and intercept of a specific cellphone.
We've got Ibrahim's Cellphone.
We need department of defense assets to extract her.
What's the time frame? The hourglass is running.
Does NSA know if Chinese intelligence has intercepted her signal?
Negative.
Negative what; Al?
I'll keep an eye out for him.
Yeah; and I'll watch your back.
I've tapped into the NSA monitoring system.
With their permission; I'm sure.
Of course.
to our own government.
That's right; I've forgotten that.
The NSA intelligence was after her; wasn't it?
She can beat this.
She's got a heart; and a mind that can win out.
You hadn't seen on years right? So what do you need to check around before invited her into your home.
Hey! Who's idea what it to contact her in the first place to pull her back into my life for political average
And is for his background checks call That's in the White House chief staff; at the CIA; the NSA and the FBI...
and this disposal. - The bottom line is we be snooker
We just serve the taelons our entire alliance strategy and our contact list on a silver platter!
Thought you might want this back.
What is this place?
NSA? CIA?
Army Intelligence?
We do market research.
What's going on?
I know this man.
Mycroft; meet the NSA.
NSA; this is Mycroft.
Let's dispense with the cat-and-mouse phase;
I know this man.
Mycroft; meet the NSA.
NSA; this is Mycroft.
Let's dispense with the cat-and-mouse phase;
if you don't mind.
So who hired you?
Think.
Better to have the NSA as a friend than the alternative.
We are working for a government friendly to your own.
They're interested in Norman's list;
My phone doesn't appear to be working-- can I borrow yours?
Was that really necessary?
That was the NSA. Hands.
Exquisite timepiece; shame it has to go.
They didn't touch my watch.
They didn't touch my watch.
Better safe than sorry.
We cannot allow the NSA to monitor us.
If they find Norman before we do; we'll have no one to trade
for Joan; and then your friends at Le Milieu will kill her.
Where's the phone?
Who are you calling?
Agent McNally of the NSA.
What on earth for?
Mycroft; you've shown yourself to be capable
And what about your buddies at the NYPD?
Why don't you appeal to their sense of decency?
The NSA has superior resources.
And a greater familiarity with the problem at hand.
You mean "problems" with an "S;" right?
first time engaging with the American Intelligence community.
I would be remiss if I delved into our previous dealings;
but suffice it to say that yours is one of several NSA fronts
that I have identified in the last 18 months.
Lantera Digital Solutions does not exist.
to a particular Pardillo construction site;
then we can shift our focus
to the NSA strand of the investigation.
It's not the first time;
of course; that your government was thought
a backdoor into our system.
We don't. PRISM is secure.
So you're saying the NSA has a mole?
No; I'm not.
Someone at the agency found Bobby Pardillo
This came through channels.
It was requested by a cop.
So you would have me believe that the NSA makes a habit
of conducting electronic surveillance
of questionable legality for any local authority
You don't have a shred of proof against him.
These accusations are not my own.
They come from the NSA.
But you are correct--
we have no proof.
So if you didn't kill Sherrington; who did?
Bit of luck; you introducing me to your friends
at the NSA the other week.
Agent McNally?
I told you-- I was a clearinghouse for MI6.
I'm already dead.
What're you talking about?
He means the NSA has agreed to fake his demise.
There was an accident
at Diogenes; a little while ago.
I am taking one last look at P versus NP.
What do you mean; "last look"?
The NSA has asked the NYPD to surrender...
everything and anything pertaining to the problem;
including Tanya Barrett.
I also had a plan in place to guarantee her safe return.
I'm sorry I had to incapacitate you;
but I couldn't risk the NSA mucking it up!
(sighs)
This is gonna take some time to process.
Among the items found
in the smuggler's truck was a prepaid cell phone.
I had someone at NSA run a matrix
on all the calls made by numbers dialed by that phone.
The phone called a number in the Mexican port of Tampico.
Section Five restricted to military projects only.
Military? You mean weapons?
Couldn't say. You need NSA clearance to enter.
Well; so much for building a better tomorrow.
Life is full of compromises; Marshal.
Interesting? It's not supposed to be interesting.
Well; the people checking up on you are real badasses.
Who are we talking... N.S.A.; C.I.A.?
Worse...
I.R.S.
transmitted via satellite phone;
with caller I.D. interrupt.
Even my N.S.A. friend couldn't trace this.
And that's giving her the key words.
No one could trace. This is KGB we are dealing with.
To your left; around the corner.
They're telling you where to go.
So much for the N.S.A. tracing the call.
Get on the next uptown bus.
Turn the tape off. Turn it back on
No!
Ilya; he knew about the sat phone trace
we set up with the N.S.A.
Did he know about the secondary backups?
Yeah; that too.
- Are you still there? - I did.
- Good job; owe. - I'm still in the system.
Who do you think that issued the warrant? Your friend from the NSA; col Grace.
Do not remember me. Who is Eddie?
I just checked and I found that has Authorized Grade 5 in the Pentagon.
people were getting nervous.
what people?
who knows? black ops? cia? nsa?
i know;it sounds paranoid even to me;
and i lived it.
Go to Hawaii. Go be alive. Are you kidding; man? It's d-day.
We need all hands on deck. No.
The place is packed with CIA; FBI; NSA. We're covered.
Mark. Go. Pick a version you like.
Dance with your bride.
Imagine how you could use this technology.
To manipulate geopolitics.
NSA just finished up with Hellinger.
It's been eight hours; and he just said his first six words...
I'm only speaking to mark benford.
Your e-mail said you had something for me.
Yeah; I do.
N.S.A. finally sent back a new rendering
of that suspect zero photo.
Hmm. Looks like the old one.
It looks like a ring.
Mm-hmm. Can the image be enhanced any further?
N.S.A. is working on it right now;
but it took them this long to get this far.
Tell them to put their foot on the gas.
I learned that Jericho's C.E. O. just tripled the security
Around his malibu compound. I think you should take a look.
Wrong department. NSA is who you want to call.
I don't want them to know.
I need this done off the books.
And in the meantime; you're getting nowhere
with tracking down Suspect Zero or D. Gibbons.
N.S.A.'s still working on the Suspect Zero video.
And we're running down digital forensics
from D. Gibbons' cell phone. For all we know;
The second that Jericho knows that I'm still alive;
they'll find me; and they'll kill me.
N.S.A. finally sent back a new rendering of Suspect Zero.
- What's that on his hand? - That looks like a ring.
This morning I was thinking about committing suicide.
This is good.
Fine. I'll go somewhere else.
The N.S.A.'s digital forensics team uncovered this symbol
on Suspect Zero's ring.
Alpha.
We captured still images as the hand moved.
We replaced pixels and then built a 3-D model of it.
Frankly; we were hoping the N.S.A. would provide us
an analysis of the ring that was a little more substantial.
To tell you the truth; I'm--I'm a little uncomfortable
Okay; I'll be blunt; Mr. Wedeck.
One of the members of your Mosaic task force
has been red-flagged by the N.S.A.
What? Who?
A couple of months ago; our wiretapping program
That's hard to do; your honor.
Yeah; that's like black-op; nba stuff.
He means nsa.
I am telling you; someone is trying to set me up.
Why can't you just get your office to call off the dogs?
Good God... we're both brown; brother.
I expect to be harassed by the FBI; the CIA;
the NSA; the TSA; but not one of our own.
Colvard Insurance brokers. You might have seen our bus.
No; I haven't seen your bus.
Edgar is totes a nauze. F-M-L.
I don't know what any of those words even mean.
I'll run it through the NSA's language translators.
Someone called claiming to be Josh's Deep Throat;
blocked number; wants to meet.
The other one was on Hicks.
We've seen one of these before.
Did the N.S.A ever determine what it was for?
A data storage device.
Apparently used to transport information.
I can't deliver John Scott's body.
And that other disk?
It didn't go to the N.S.A.
Where did it go?
One of the advantages
The truth is; they were and they are...
government agents.
NSA; secret task force.
And so was I.
I don't believe you.
I understand.
Thanks for checking.
My contact at NSA. Couldn't confirm
a single thing that John said.
Of course; John said they wouldn't be able to.
It's what caused the explosion I want you to see.
We had it transported here late last night.
We've got NSA
and CDC gathering data.
But Dr. Bishop;
I should get back.
As you can imagine; there are some interagency fires to quash.
NSA considered that device their personal property.
They're looking for an explanation.
So I'll see you tomorrow?
So any idea what it is?
Not yet.
But I'm hoping our friends at the nsa
Will be able to tell us.
So 11 innocent people die today;
Are you registered?
What?
Nsa-cia.
I was registered at pottery barn when i got married.
That's about it.
Oh; that is awful.
I was a colonel in the gulf war.
I still have friends in the nsa.
Buddy of mine sent me this link.
Government doesn't want this to get out.
(snorting)
ZOE: My mother is nothing but a disappointment.
No; she wouldn't call the NSA for me.
I just wanted to know all the people
George Tucker had called and e-mailed.
GYLES: Wonderful.
And Brazilian computer hackers mistook NASA
for the NSA; the National Security Agency.
Do you know what message they left on NASA's website?
There's nothing there. Well; the message said...
in Spain; France; Germany and everywhere else; it seems.
And all of this came to light how?
Well; the NSA's been spying religiously on all these things;
and now it's out in the open. This is the progression of it all.
Celebrity hacks in the US; and the NSA;
Well; the NSA's been spying religiously on all these things;
and now it's out in the open. This is the progression of it all.
Celebrity hacks in the US; and the NSA;
they have used the technology to get into the phones of these celebrities.
They can't fix their own health care; there's no health care in America;
They can't fix their own health care; there's no health care in America;
the whole thing is completely "fakakta."
But they can spy on celebrities; using the NSA technology brilliantly.
And the German leader. Of course; she's a celebrity...
LAUGHTER
Yeah; spot on. Nice.
There we go; one point for that.
I was briefed by the NSA before coming on. Can you name them all?
Absolutely; there's the Spanish; there's Merkel and there's 34 others.
That's 33 others.
It's so brilliant and American!
It's very aspirational; it's an aspirational thing.
The American Dream now is to be spied on and to be on a show by the NSA.
What did the Russians discover was spying on them this week?
Space monkeys.
Ah; Bond; leave it alone. It'll boil in five minutes.
And which other world power is annoyed
that their data has been stolen by the NSA? Germany.
No; I mean "world" power. Jamaica.
It's Google. According to David Drummond;
just to yank an ordinary guy off the streets.
This guy's not ordinary.
Lowry's ex-NSA.
He used to have top-secret security clearance.
Which means his abduction could be
of covert SEAL team lists.
And revenge.
Source of mine at NSA says
the cartel hired a hacker to break in
to the supposedly secure naval database.
but he's having trouble
because it's encrypted
using NSA-level firewalls.
All right; so our bank robbers hired Ian
to help pull off this heist.
Will you speak English for me; please?
With this thing; we got no secrets.
NSA can't do anything about it;
'cause they aren't even sure it exists.
And China; they denied ever building it.
Hey; how'd it go with the Navy?
They're stonewalling.
I got more of the same with NSA and Homeland.
What about the Coast Guard?
They find anything? Nothing on the ocean floor
This guy's killed three people already today.
Yeah; look; this could raise some flags.
Classify it as an NSA request from a black ops drop box.
Okay? Come on; Cath; I need this.
You know; you're like the good-looking guy
- Who said I forgave you? - Huh.
Hello; Quentin. Vanessa; have you met Colonel Blair?
Not in person; but I read about your appointment to the NSA.
DC must be a nice change from Bagram Air Force Base.
The food is better. Traffic is worse.
I want to talk about Operation Total Information.
Colonel Blair; I know that you've been running point
on this program since you arrived at the NSA.
- How's it going? - OTI's been a valuable tool for us; Mr. President.
We've used it to thwart hundreds of terrorist attacks.
(CHUCKLING) If not here; where?
This is the most secure building in the country.
The NSA is lucky to have you.
The work you're doing with Operation Total Information is...
of vital importance.
without her doctor's consent.
They're looking for her; but she's off the grid.
Nobody is off the grid to the NSA.
Your decision not to kill Kincaid has made everything more complicated.
It also creates a problem getting the bone marrow out of the hospital.
This is Vanessa Moore. My sister.
Vanessa; have you met Colonel Blair?
Not in person; but I read about your appointment to the NSA.
I loved your brother very much.
He would have been President someday.
named Steve Patterson?
How did you know that?
You forget? I'm with the NSA.
Steve Patterson is part of an ongoing FBI investigation;
we think he might be playing ball with a drug cartel.
The team we have in place are professionals.
- They'll disappear the minute it's over. - And then?
NSA intercepts will be leaked to the press implicating a foreign terrorist cell.
Money transfers will point to the involvement
of a certain Middle Eastern country.
wasn't really for weather satellites.
According to our Russian friends;
the code was actually to protect NSA spy satellites.
So what do we do now?
Call your wife's bosses;
We'll; uh...
Ahem!
We'll alert the NSA about that code.
Oh.
The one you gave them will never go operational.
I'm gonna make sure that this thing
gets into the right hands.
I'm gonna make a copy for the FBI; the NSA;
Department of Justice; and; well; hell;
I might even make a copy for some newspapers
Because that's what I would do.
Nelson: Guys; we have a problem.
NSA picked up a Chinese embassy cable to Beijing.
The ambassador was found dead; and Kate is missing.
As you'd expect; they think she killed him.
Well; we knew Hector was unhappy with the Geo-9.
He had made some threats.
So; prophylactically; we got the NSA to monitor
all comint into and out of the committee.
We didn't anticipate the kidnapping.
Gordon Greyson?
Oh; yeah. This guy's the real deal.
NSA watchlist; tSA no-fly.
He's corresponded with at least four of the five victims.
How could you know that?
It's none of your damn business.
Who do you work for?
NSA!
- Did you know about this? - No!
- And the Admiral didn't either. - Lieutenant Commander Keeter?
The software system Alexi Barkov is downloading
for the Iranians is phony.
Secretary Bair; who's with NSA; not State;
was running the sting without the Navy's knowledge
and; therefore; without my knowledge.

That's why I"m moving slowly.
Don't move too slowly.
NSA decrypts indicate...
el-jihad is poised to launch another gray hull attack.
Which ship ?
That's why
I need you in that room.
NSA encrypts indicate
that the money has been passed.
The attack can happen any time.
While I was there; she took a call from a Lt. Abby Cowen.
- Who's that? - I'm trying to find that out now.
You know that Webb's father worked for NSA
and his mother broke Russian code?
I thought they were old-money types.
- Why do you say that? - Well; after Harvard;
Webb did some postgraduate work at the National Cryptographic School.
Did Webb ever work for NSA?
Fourteen months; to be exact.
Did he go to the State Department after that?

- Excuse me. - Sure.
Y'all lawyers or bill collectors?
NSA.
I'm Agent Duarte; this is Agent Foley.
Sir; would you please put that away?
I was just kidding. Make it fifty.
Actually Mr... Dick;
your NSA contract is pretty specific on the matter:
You can be recalled to active duty at any time.
Failure to comply can result in arrest;
I want to know what you are.
- I don't know what you're talking about. - Yes; you do.
What did those bastards at the NSA do to you; kid?
You know; you and I may have more in common than you think.
Way back when you were just a tickle
Way back when you were just a tickle
in your daddy's pouch;
the NSA had these programs.
Enhancement programs: Steroids;
G-H-B; H-G-H.
um; I mean; I'm not familiar with any;
but I would have to say that there were; yeah.
I mean; the NSA has more research money
than any other intelligence agency and they have a mandate
to stay ahead of the curve; so...
I'm reporting to duty per the activation clause in my contract.
And with all due respect; I don't understand
how the NSA shared critical mission information
without first verifying the identity of an operative.
Wait. Hold on.
Look; I'm sorry you were duped; son.
But the soviet agent that was impersonating me
was using you to find out everything the NSA
knows about Dankova's plan.
And we're three steps behind them.
- He may be our only chance. - We're working on it.
What happened to him?
The NSA.
Thirty years of being pulled every which direction.
God knows what else they did to him.

I don't believes he speaks swahili.
- It's nice to meet you both. - Likewise.
- So; you're my bodyguard. - Yeah.
Are they downsizing at the NSA?
Well; didn't you hear? Scrawny's the new big.
All right; ground rules.
The crown prince of Tajir didn't think it was so bad.
He wore it with pride.
Or I tell the NSA you're not cooperating.
Can I borrow your cell?
All right. I'll be waiting.
What are you talking about; Ann?
I just saw your bodyguard hand off something to a woman
I can only assume was another NSA Agent.
What was it?
I don't know what you're talking about.
- All right. Peace. - Have fun.
Why are you still here?
Look; I can call the NSA and shut this whole thing down.
Go for it.
Hello!
Apparently; there's no "we" in nanites.
Well; I'm not surprised.
A few months of NSA field work is no cure
for a childhood full of James Bond movies.
Well; I think we better find a cure.
Well; Tank Buster;
the day has finally come - I'm actually glad
you traded in your Blackhawk for a desk at the NSA.
- Well; that makes me nervous. - And well it should.
Fort McClelland serves as a repository

So are you ready to do this?
Sure.

If anyone buys a radiac meter anywhere in the world;
I want someone with NSA creds
standing by to ask why.
- Understood? - Yes; ma'am.
This man and I need to settle our affairs in private.
With all due respect; General;
you called the NSA;
and I'm not about to leave you alone
with a member of an elite assassination unit.
He's not an officer.
His name is Agent Duarte;
and he's a spook for the NSA.
I take it this man has knowledge of our operation.
Yeah; Freewald called him in to find out who took the Hades 13.

Hey; you ever think they'll ever send me to Tunisia
or someplace like Tunisia; someplace exotic?
Jake; this is the NSA.
We're the largest and most powerful intelligence agency in the world.
all charged with the awesome responsibility
Right.
Now; as to the reason we're here.
The NSA intercepted a phone call.
An unidentified state department official
is attempting to sell some information.
- Everybody down! Federal agent! - Hey stop!
- Hand it over! - What?
I'm with the NSA; pal. I saw everything.
- Jake; what are you doing? - I got him Kyle. I got him.
Jake; he's not even one of ours.
- You did? - Yeah.
The thing is; it's actually kind of silly.
Well-well; the NSA wanted to upgrade some computer systems;
but they didn't want the CIA to find out about it;
because they-they want the same thing; so...
Because the target's not out there.
The target's here; where we're most vulnerable.
He detonates that bomb inside the NSA;
we lose all our satellite links; all our communications.
There's a worldwide security blackout.
They knew what we were doing before half our men did.
Now; can you explain to me how I let my son
walk right into an NSA sting?
You didn't crypt the final transmission to our people in Virginia.
Ethan...
before smackdown. Thanks.
Any progress?
- We know he's NSA. - We knew that yesterday.
We know he's local. We believe he works out of Fort Mead.
I want the name and location of the man
You a secret agent or something?
Huh?
I snuck a peek at your NSA badge.
You naughty little girl; you.
- There you go. - So; are you? An agent?
Fo-ley! Fo-ley!
Anything on Foley?
NSA has him listed as a tech support;
but our people in payroll can't confirm this.
There's no record of him on file.
would you give them my I.D. and pretend to be me?
First of all; you have a much better driving record;
and second; you're NSA -
they should've let you walk out of professional courtesy.
What is wrong with you?
What? I don't know what you're talking about.
I don't know you. Why are you doing this to me?
This is the NSA nowadays?
We're going to win this war.
I'm talking about my family; Jake;
- I told you... - Caleb; he has my brother.
He wants you in exchange. Now I figure we've got about two minutes
before the NSA figures out that you're gone and I took you.
So if you ever want to see your dad again; you call him. Now!
Louise;
Come on.
Watch your back. There are friendlies in the building! Standing by.
This is the NSA. Throw down your weapons
and come out with your hands up! You are surrounded.
Hold your ground.
Okay; enough of the Gilmore Girls. Let's roll.
- So; can I ask you one question? - Sure.
What exactly do you do at the NSA?
I could tell you; but then I'd have to kill you.
I could tell you; but then I'd have to kill you.
Huh; God; I hate tequila.
Whoo! Dude; six o‚Äôclock.
- Pull out your NSA badge. - Why?
Because chicks dig spies.
Yeah; but they don't dig geeks.
Excuse me; ladies.
I'm Agent Darin Metcalf. This is Agent Jake Foley.
- Hi. - You guys work for the NSA?
- Yes. - Yes.
That's so sexy. Do you have a license to kill?
Yeah. I read about you in alumni notes.
You're working for Senator Thompson. Congratulations.
Thank you. I see you're still at the NSA.
Oh; don't tell me - this is your way of picking up the ladies?
No; no. No; no; no. This... I; uh...
You remember what I told you about the budget discrepancies at the DoD?
- Yeah; yeah; unused funds or something? - They weren't unused; Jake.
They were diverted... to the NSA.
- What? - Yeah. Nobody knows what it's for;
and whoever does wants to make sure I don't find out.
- What? - That's why they came for me.
Obviously; I was getting too close to something
the NSA doesn't want us to know about.
Sarah; maybe you should
consider just leaving that alone.
I'm calling this hearing to order. Please sit.
Let the record show
that six years ago; NSA began working
on project Free Target
exploring the use of nanites -
and tell us what happened
regarding this operation starting November 17.
Deputy Director Louise Beckett; NSA.
On the 17th of this month; there was a break-in
at the Densmore Research Facility in Alexandria; Virginia.
So; she did go to your room?
Yes.
And you had NSA hardware;
which; if breached; could have compromised your mission?
Excuse me.
Okay?
Now; who are you?
I'm NSA
Great.
You're after the varcon as well.
Find them now!
What the hell are you?
I told you. I'm an agent with the NSA.
I didn't ask who. I asked what.
You survived exposure to varcon gas. Nobody does that.
- Angela. - No.
All right.
I work with a Special Ops team at the NSA.
A team that will do anything for me;
including bringing this Alonzo guy in.
So how'd you meet?
Just at work.
So you're a doctor at the NSA?
Mm-hmm. Yes; Research.
That must be really interesting.
No. No; no. That wouldn't make any sense.
Uh; did I say 'division'?
'Cause really in the NSA; it's more like;
um; like-like 'wings'.
No; thanks.
you can't tell this to anyone ever.
So; let me get this straight; um...
you're a secret agent at the NSA;
and... there-there are these tiny robots...
Computers; really. Microscopic computers.
Not for his safety; but by Miss Kawalski.
- We can combine what we know - - What do you know?
I work for a branch of the NSA.
We seek an organization with ties to the Middle East.
We follow their movements for some time ...
MAN: Unlogged priority call on line four; Mr. President.
I'm surprised to hear from you; Amanda.
My boys at NSA are reporting that you're dead.
WALLER: We had a security breach at Cadmus.
I had the facility scrubbed and moved per standard protocol.
Well; you wouldn't find me on one of them websites anyway; you know?
I mean; did you know that...
Colt! ...the NSA's got all kinds of things...
Oh; whoa. No! Hold on! Hold on!
Hold on; boys! Look; look; look.
[toilet flushes] Come on; Ava. We got to get out of here.
- Tim: Just need to be within 100 yards. - Rachel: What if the windows are closed?
Tim: No; this NSA shit is next-level.
- This picks up vibrations off glass. - Wendy: So; you really haven't done
- enough yet to destroy my family; huh? - Raylan: I'm done talking to you.
Hey; Atkins.
What happened to your face?
- Get me the NSA on the phone. - Ls that a joke?
You know; this whole thing is one big joke.
My real name's Tom.
You know; this whole thing is one big joke.
My real name's Tom.
Right. I'll-- I'll get the NSA on the phone.
Where are we with this whole time zone issue?
Are they feeding you?
His name is Atkins.
Yeah. Thanks.
That was really the NSA?
- They said hi. - Why are you looking--?
- For Knapp? - How is the NSA--?
That was really the NSA?
- They said hi. - Why are you looking--?
- For Knapp? - How is the NSA--?
Knapp changes his phone all the time.
Turner sweeps his car every day for trackers. Can't LoJack him.
- I'll do that. - Right. Sorry.
What cell doesn't keep a record of calls or ID the service?
CIA; NSA; FBI.
PMC.
Come here.
You could afford to replace it; but you don't.
Something important must be on it.
But the man whose agency oversees the CIA and the NSA
doesn't use his own guys to find it.
He turns to a couple of P.I.s.
Pizza.
Backroom poker.
A political haunt our N.S.A. buddy; Larry; played at.
From the size of Jose's transfers;
I'm guessing he had a gambling debt.
Who did; billy?
It was torres
And a ton of nsa guys.
He totally betrayed us.
And he was talking about the karr project.
Also; I found a package in graiman's office
Addressed to the both of you.
I managed to get it out before the nsa
Had their garage sale.
I sent it overnight.
Don't bother.
His name is jack hurst;
N.s.a.
Yeah; well; he's the guy
Torres told to shut us down.
The cameras on your identity badges
Are linked real time
With the nsa's facial recognition database.
So we should be able to help you find nikki and max.
Be careful.
Not reliable.
I've hit a road block.
We're still locked out of the GOVERNMENT SECURITY DATABASES; Nsa; dhs; cia; interpol.
Billy; if flag's going to have a chance of succeeding;
We're gonna need access to those networks.
His name is victor galt.
??? ASSASIN AND THIEF.
And based on nsa chatter;
CROSS REFERENCING LEADS It looks like the north koreans contracted him To steal the hxp formula.
Don't we have a photo?
I'll be emailing that to myself for later.
We have a mission update.
Last night;nsa intercepted
Encoded chinese satellite transmissions
Sent via next gen u.s. military equipment.
Is Billy almost to the dad's house?
Yes; he should be there shortly.
NSA; CIA; FBI; DEA; DOD?
If there's a security agency in the government;
with a three-letter acronym; they answer to you.
Oh; man; she is gonna be-- oh; yeah.
Guys!
This man couriered stolen nsa intelligence to north korea;
Smuggled Ali Atwa out of afghanistan;
Delivered weapons to african rebels.
According to the state department;
She's a businesswoman.
According to the nsa; she's s.V.R.
According to me; she's hot.
Sluzhba vnyeshney razvyedkee?
Jack Miller; 232nd; Zulu.
Give it a rest; Jack.
Who sent you? N.S.A? F.B.I?
My name's Cassandra Banks.
MI-6.
We haven't had a bird in the sky
Since the government shut us down
Then co-op one from the N.S.A. Or C.I.A.
That'll leave us completely exposed
Zoe's right. It's too risky
- Isn't Beachwood a high school? - Yes; it is.
You have a problem with that; Alexander?
No offense; Stephen; but the NSA would have a hard time
cracking my sub-laced elliptically curved 384-bit module system
with a 256-bit encryption.
Not bad. Maybe we can use it.
What would you like to do with Shays and Spidel?
We don't need them. They're non-hostile. Hand them over to NSA.
I still don't know why I've gotta go do this.
Oh; Stanley; it's no big deal.
If I were you; I'd be more concerned about stayin' alive.
The formula. Please.
- NSA vehicle was ambushed. - What happened?
The agents were killed; along with Spidel.
What about Shays?
Sequence completed.
Let's go.
We pulled NSA's ass out of the fire once again.
Report shows we had 100% containment.
Everything went as planned.
It was a bogus code.
Probably a decoy.
Not according to our friends from the NSA.
- What did they say? - That the information was in the code.
The data you extracted was simply an outer shell.
Actually; he still lives with his mother.
Would he cooperate with his government?
He's turned down NSA and other agencies who have tried to enlist him.
His mother doesn't want her only child designing weapons.
Then we'll have to take him against his will.
Okay; all right; they wanted me to...
help them develop a system for the Gamma Project.
That'll fly with the NSA.
Before we can release you...
you will need to sign several non-disclosure statements.
- He could be dead. - I hope not.
Right now; he's our only link to whoever's responsible for this.
- What about the NSA sheets? - Too many names.
Nothing for me to work with given the time restraint.
- That's why we need Allen. - Did you get the blood work back?
Or maybe Deline's dead.
Worse things could happen.
Nah; just for yuks; I had the NSA bird
shoot some video
on its last pass over Vegas.
I work for your brother now.
You still know what this is?
We developed it for NSA domestic surveillance.
Plug it into the USB port of the car.
Give it 20 seconds for the program to migrate.
Croft's a black hole.
Who does that?
DOD; NSA.
Why?
We can fire a missile off a ship in the Gulf of Oman.
She's a pain in the ass;
but one of the alphabets would have scooped her up.
NSA; atf; dod
got over a thousand government agencies working counterterr.
And that's not even counting the private sector.
We found an old lady across the street
lives on her windowsill.
She's better than the N.S.A.
What do you got for Friday night?
Yeah; I'm just getting there. Hold on.
I was worried the tapes would be protected.
Huge defense contractor like that;
I figured he'd have NSA-level encryption.
But it only took my team a few hours to crack.
A few hours?
Ensign.
It's a private intelligence agency under contract
to the NSA.
Owned by Verax; run by ex-spies.
Verax has a private CIA?
to be planning world domination and a new world order.
Sorry. I'll take off the tinfoil.
NSA is monitoring all comms on a designated channel; so we'll be
- fully aware of his movements. - Tell me again
why the prince didn't change his plans.
MAGGIE: We've got a lock on the prince's location.
He's closing in on Arcadia.
NSA intercepts
say no suspicious chatter at this time.
So just how far are you prepared to go;
None of those matched up... then I remembered this guy
That I dated last year who
Worked for the nsa; and he was so
Into the modern surveillance state;
And how great it would be for society
That's a start. What's the rest?
There's the problem. Their cybersecurity
is about as airtight as the NSA.
There's gotta be some type of way.
There's always a way. It just depends
They're employee identification codes
for Verax. I had friends
- at the NSA check the codes. - I hope
- they didn't send up any red flags. - They covered their inquiries.
There are a lot of people out there who share our concerns
I can see the robber.
I look in the basis for identifying facial
linked to the NSA and the FBI.
If these types are known; sooner rather quickly.
It was fast.
Oh; no. No; no; no; no.
You are getting query spiked all over the grid.
Nsa. Cia. Oss.
I-I don't even know what that -- You know what?
You want to play rough? We gonna play rough.
Anzway; five months ago; she asked me to steal records
Of money-laundering through blood diamonds.
Now; the cia; the nsa; the russians
Were moving black-ops money through alexander moto.
Now; you cover your tracks perfectly --
OH; ALSO...
THIS IS THE SHORT VERSION?
...FACIAL RECOGNITION DATABASE TIED INTO CIA; NSA; AND THE FBI.
BUT THE REAL PI√®CE DE R√©SISTANCE...
...DIRECTV HD TOTAL SPORTS PACKAGE --
It's not as creepy as the number of Dustmen that hold high positions
in intelligence agencies around the world.
You got CIA; MI6; NSA; Mossad.
It's a feeder fraternity for spies.
Well; the file that the Boston PD had on Shaevel's death
It's not as creepy as the number of Dustmen that hold high positions
in intelligence agencies around the world.
You got CIA; MI6; NSA; Mossad.
It's a feeder fraternity for spies.
Well; the file that the Boston PD had on Shaevel's death
Sorry; sir.
I don't trust phone companies.
They're all crooks in cahoots with the NSA.
So I just simply cut the line.
Snip snip snip. [Chuckles]
I-I don't understand why people bother
to... to lock their phones.
The NSA are listening in on every damn call anyway.
Now; I need you to give me your pass code; Sean.
I forgot.
just like Fisher said.
Where is he now?
SIGINT from NSA has him in Guinea.
With whom we don't have an extradition treaty.
You want me to hold his identity?
but it was the last.
If you have a shred of decency in you; Dr. Evans...
It's Major Evans. I work for the NSA.
Whoever you are;
I just want to go home.
CIA.
FBI.
NSA.
NAACP.
God!
All I'm asking is; if your conclusion is a wobbler;
let the answer lean towards the truth.
NSA? Contractors? The U.N.?
There are forces at play much larger than you know; Dr. Connor.
- Yes? - I think we've got something.
Okay; well; recently the World Health Organization...
No. Next.
The NSA is tracking over a billion cellphones...
[Imitates telephone ringing]
What's that? The whole country's bored?
and I'll make sure your mom and dad are there to meet you; okay?
Sir; everyone's losing satellite coverage;
NSA; Pentagon; commercial networks.
How big can these dust storms get?
Don't think of it as dust.
- We caught them heading out the back. - Zero?
- Just these guys. - You don't know what you're doing.
What is this place? NSA? CIA? MYLAB?
A private biomedical facility conducting important research.
Yeah; I heard. Wrap 'em up.
I don't know what's going on; but I don't really think she did this to herself.
Baldwin; you keep working on the plane crash. Hollis; I want you to get on this.
Can you believe it? The US Army; NSA; CIA; Joint Chiefs; all hanging on every word
this woman; 512; uttered as she spacewalked through East bloc military installations.
- I mean; spying. What were they thinking? - That it was working.
Surveillance.
They ask assistant manager; but he not know this is here.
I watch everybody just like nsa.
Do you know what; uh... what salter was looking for?
He was looking for
All right; but what if it wasn't a bug?
What if... Check this out. I forget what page it is.
There's an article in there; uh; that talks about the N.S.A.
taking a regular smartphone
and turning it into a recording device;
I mean; all you'd need to do
is hack through the login into the O.S.
and drop a piece of N.S.A. malware into the system update.
It's pretty simple.
But wouldn't you need a federal warrant?
...From a phone... Isn't that a full wipe?
Like; gone forever?
I mean; unless you're some -- on some nsa list or something?
Or you work for applsn.
Well; what does that mean?
But i wanna know who you're working for.
Who...do you work for?
You're not stuffy enough to be n.s.a.
No c.i.a.swagger.
So...Let me be more specific this time.
And you'll be holding the door for me.
Agent Callen;
six weeks ago an NSA analyst named Kelvin Atley went missing.
After he disappeared; the NSA discovered
Atley had used his clearance to access
Agent Callen;
six weeks ago an NSA analyst named Kelvin Atley went missing.
After he disappeared; the NSA discovered
Atley had used his clearance to access
a highly classified file; code-named Cherokee.
That's a nice try.
But Atley's gay.
He thought he kept it a secret from the NSA;
but it's noted in his personnel file.
Welcome to the game; Agent Callen.
He's Iranian.
He runs an international air freight business;
and the NSA believes
he has close ties to Iranian intelligence.
What if Atley already told Janvier
You're a popular guy; Atley.
A lot of people want to talk to you.
NSA; Pentagon; FBI; State Department;
not to mention the CIA.
(chuckles) Those guys really; really; really
Of course.
Everybody; listen up.
NSA intercepted a phone call
between Vaziri and Tehran overnight.
Vaziri told Tehran that an NCIS agent
GRANGER: Ops. Now.
ERIC: Something's going down in Tehran.
NSA picked up a major spike in telecommunications traffic.
Most of it's internal--
intelligence agencies; key government ministers;
intelligence agencies; key government ministers;
the military.
NELL: NSA intercepted
a burst transmission from Vaziri to Tehran
an hour after they received Atley's USB.
And Vaziri just received an encrypted e-mail
from Tehran 30 minutes ago.
NSA's still decrypting it.
Okay; we need to see that; Eric.
Well; that would require us looking over their shoulder
Just doing it.
(clears throat)
ERIC: Okay; hacking the NSA.
And...
we're in.
Tell me what you know about Atley.
Atley...
was an NSA analyst.
He turned traitor.
He knew the CIA had a spy in Tehran
Agent callen; agent hanna.
Director.
Nsa completed a preliminary review.
Sub program's security protocols
Do not appear to have been breached.
Here he comes.
What agency is this guy with?
Cia-nsa-dod.
Some say he's a black ops handler for all three.
But he's our guy.
Do we have any idea who's paying?
Yes. A man named Larry Basser.
He's a former NSA agent.
Any ties to Afghanistan?
He's been all over the Middle East.
Any ties to Afghanistan?
He's been all over the Middle East.
Joined the NSA after a career in the Army.
Spent lots of time in Russia in the early '80s.
He settled down in L.A.
Did you use us to do your leg work?
You have longer legs.
Why'd Basser leave the NSA?
He was ousted when a; uh; a case
he was running in Fallujah ended tragically.
So Basser is driving business to the land he already owns.
Mm-hmm.
Why would a decorated soldier and career NSA agent
betray his country?
Larry saw his best friend die in Fallujah.
betray his country?
Larry saw his best friend die in Fallujah.
The NSA turned its back on him.
They made him the scapegoat.
He was never the same.
ERIC: And then stole the laptop to cover his tracks.
What do you got; Nell?
NELL: NSA cell phone intercepts.
Chatter is on the rise. It's all coded.
The term "ambassador" is used multiple times;
A couple months; that's all.
I better tell the team.
Eric and Nell are checking cell phone calls with the NSA.
We might have leads on Spears within the hour.
I want this guy.
A call made to a satellite phone
3√Ç¬Ω minutes after Spears slipped away.
NSA routinely records satellite phone calls.
This is what they got.
I need you to get me out of here now.
How do you know I'm not?
I'm still breathing.
My guess is CIA; NSA; DoD?
I need you to come with me.
Let's go.
Soviet agents are here now;
armed with nuclear weapons?
The NSA and the CIA are already tracking our investigation.
That means their interest is most definitely real.
All of this explains
Spears talked to on the satellite phone?
Still listening.
Nell's up to her ass in NSA audio tape.
You like working with Paris?
Yeah.
It was used as a presidential retreat
for Gerald Ford;
last used as a safe house for NSA; NCIS;
CIA; anyone who needed it.
Hetty's sending us a message-- she's taking a stand.
So why'd those guys come after you?
Okay. Thank you.
NSA says there's been no Barbosa-related chatter.
Everyone's laying low.
Could mean something big's going down.
How well you know Carver?
- Um; been with Homeland Security since the startup. - Before that?
NSA?
Try CIA.
In '91; he was trying to get a sneak peek at top-secret Soviet hardware
All right. I'll start in.
Bishop...
NSA? Oh; uh;
clearances passed. We can head over there now
and-and swap intel with them.
I'm sorry; I didn't catch the name.
Robert Redford; I am very rude.
NSA Senior Intelligence Analyst Sofia Martinez.
Yeah; look at that. I got the NSA part; 'cause we're
in the NSA.
Robert Redford; I am very rude.
NSA Senior Intelligence Analyst Sofia Martinez.
Yeah; look at that. I got the NSA part; 'cause we're

Well; I just figured
All right. I'll start in.
Bishop...

Robert Redford; I am very rude.
NSA Senior Intelligence Analyst Sofia Martinez.
Yeah; look at that. I got the NSA part; 'cause we're
in the NSA.
Well; I just figured
NSA Senior Intelligence Analyst Sofia Martinez.
Yeah; look at that. I got the NSA part; 'cause we're
in the NSA.
Well; I just figured
you enjoy the particulars; Very Special Agent.
I'll send him out to you; Doc.
Hayat just made an outgoing call.
U.S. country code. NSA jurisdiction is foreign.
I'm on the trace.
Patching the call through.
I'll send him out to you; Doc.
Hayat just made an outgoing call.
U.S. country code. NSA jurisdiction is foreign.
I'm on the trace.
Patching the call through.
I did not pick up any chatter
on the stolen dual-band radar.
Talked with contacts at the NSA and CIA.
They're alerted.
- Where are we going? - Interview.
Where?
The Appalachian Mountains.
NSA did a satellite
scan of the area.
Found his bike five miles from Greenup.
They're an offshoot of the Mujahideen.
Didn't know they had a presence here in the United States.
Don't know. NSA is checking into it.
You questioned Sayif.
Did he mention Jihad Al Hurriya?
Echelon's picking up chatter; emanating in real time
from the Washington; DC metropolitan area.
This is Barry Kester with NSA.
Special Agent Gibbs.
Hey. We locked on the IP address
Wasn't an accident.
Any news about my daughter?
NSA got a hit. They're downloading the footage now.
NSA? Does Gibbs know?
Know about what?
Any news about my daughter?
NSA got a hit. They're downloading the footage now.
NSA? Does Gibbs know?
Know about what?
Do they have something?
It's online now; Agent McGee.
Working off what Abby gave us;
an NSA satellite came up with this thermal footage early this morning over Hickory Grove;Virginia.
Found unusual activity.
We convinced NSA to give us a look at photos from one of their keyhole imaging satellites.

No facial recognition on the man.
He never looked up.
But since most water supplies are tested by law;we could pinpoint a general location.
The water she was drinking was from eastern Prince William County.
NSA kept an eye out for her.
It's like a spot in the dark; a hot spot.
Two;as it turned out.
Before you murdered two men.
Ted Bankston.
Former NSA analyst.
Yes.
Says you left NSA 12 months ago; accused of mishandling classified information.
How long?
Almost a year.
I thought when I left the NSA; it would end.
But now he uses me as a drop man for Lee.
I will tell you whatever you want to know; go wherever you want me to go.
what's going to happen tomorrow.
And I don't know if my wife's even going to be alive tomorrow.
Boss;NSA report you requested.
Bankston?
Back story checks out.
Bankston?
Back story checks out.
Dates;reason he left the NSA;everything.
- Yeah;Gibbs. - My office.
On my way.
No;I want you to talk faster.
Faster-- okay.
NSA finally returned my call; which is good;
because I was starting to think that their cooperation on the satellite thing was just a one-night stand.
And I wouldn't want NCIS to get the reputation of being easy...
Just like Patterson.
Well; I guess that lets Commander Weidman off the hook.
Boss. Tasked an NSA satellite.
I got an infrared image of the cabin here.
Heat signature from the fireplace. Somebody's there.
sit tight.
Sit tight?
Just hung up with NSA.
They're combing the airwaves.
If that helo puts out a signal; someone will hear it.
- 250 miles. - All right; let me know.
Still no distress signal;
but I'm pulling some strings with the NSA
to get us some deeper access.
Well; let's leave no string unpulled.
Anything else we can do?
I really wish there was; Director.
It's Jake. NSA.
Uh; Jimmy; take over from here.
Me? Yeah; just hit ‚ÄúEnter‚Äù when Abby says.
Access; Director.
Well; hasn't your computer been corrupted?
Oh; I'm on NSA's network; Ducky; not ours.
My husband patched me in and MTAC routed our request
for an infrared GPS satellite feed through DOD.
into this theory.
Uh; I can save you the time.
FBI; CIA; NSA--
they... they'd all refer you to me.
I am the Parsa expert.
they... they'd all refer you to me.
I am the Parsa expert.
Just how long has NSA had you on him?
Six years; Director.
Excuse me?
I'm asking you now; Bishop.
What aren't you telling me?
The details to that NSA assignment are compartmented.
I can't tell you without the proper clearance.
You can't tell me?
I saw it coming after I heard you assigned Bishop to Parsa.
Care to shed a little light on that for me? You know I can't
divulge any specific NSA operational details
with you; right?
Don't be specific; but you got to give me something; Marlens.
You can understand that.
Why do you think I'm here?
When Bishop first started at NSA;
she was a deployed analyst assigned to the Middle East.
Her mission was preemptive terror analysis--
Which means she was pulled from the assignment.
Reassigned. Why?
NSA felt it was in her best interest.
And that's really all I can say about it.
Look; Gibbs; if you really want to look out for Bishop;
Little bathroom campfire.
Oh.
NSA dropped this off for you.
What is Operation Street Sweep?
Our leverage.
The chess moves I talk about?
Who do you think taught me the game?
You withheld that from the NSA.
I knew they'd pull me if they found out;
which... they did.
What do you get?
A conversation.
I have unfinished business with NSA analyst
Eleanor Bishop.
Abby?
He was trying to make some sort of a connection with her
to get her to understand him.
I need NSA's recorded phone calls
between Parsa and his sister.
Any that mention their parents.
you two know something about Abby and Burt.
Talk.
Remember; I was NSA.
I know how to find out your darkest secrets.
Gibbs has rules;
- Yeah. - No.
Buckle up.
NSA is worried about the Horn of Africa.
Somalia; in particular.
Increased chatter?
who haven't attended in past years.
Royce made his billions in shipping and mining; not arms.
Maybe we should notify NSA.
I'll brief them.
We have to act quickly.
Bingo. So how did it get there; Abigail?
What are we watching?
It's an NSA decryption program scanning
all possible connections between people on the list.
There's a five and a three in all their Social Security numbers.
Are you serious?
It's compartmented;
but we need an NSA Alpha Team
to pinpoint Amir's exact location ASAP.
I can't authorize an Alpha Team.
about missing your Halloween party.
Oh; that's okay-- I'm sure you had some...
super big; top secret emergency NSA meeting
that you couldn't miss.
Uh; we were being audited; actually.
As you can see; Jake is quite real.
Unless he's a hologram that can shake hands.
NSA's actually working on one of those-- I've seen the prototype.
(laughs): Yeah; that'd be pretty fun.
(chuckles)
How do I know that guy?
So; anyway; there I was;
still trying to be cool on my second day at NSA.
It was my second day; your third.
Right. I always mix that up. Mm-hmm.
Well; I have to talk about something;
since we can't talk shop anymore.
When we were both at NSA; we'd debrief every night
after work-- but now that he's restricted
from telling me anything;
You knew.
We're just hearing the chatter now?
NSA heard about it days ago.
Well; I'm... I'm a lawyer; Tony.
My ear's not exactly pressed to the pipeline.
All it manages to do is scare people.
I also know that you would have never kept a secret
if I was still at NSA. It's not a secret; Ellie; it's just a...
you know; slightly calculated omission.
You know what that sounds like? Like a reasonable justification.
getting my cranberries started; but we can't have everything.
You have your service weapons?
Oh; not me. I'm a-an attorney; with NSA.
Attorneys stand over there; please.
Be careful.
in the conservatory with the wrench?
Don't tell me you're enjoying this.
You know the NSA; sweetheart-- we don't get out much.
London; Brussels; Athens...
Speaking of Brussels-- fun fact:
location so you could stop the missile instead of him;
which would have necessitated blowing his cover.
Only an NSA satellite can GPS an encrypted phone.
Ari didn't know I had that asset.
You give him less credit than he gives you.
Call him.
You can't trace it from here; Gibbs.
Need a high-level NSA intercept.
Patch us through.
You're talking dedicated satellite time and...
Patch us through.
You're talking dedicated satellite time and...
I've got two NSA satellites in range for the next five minutes; Gunny.
What's the number?
Are you sure about this?
that one out for yourselves; agent Gibbs.
Now; what does that sound like to you; Tony?
It sounds like one of the A's. CIA; NSA.
About those boxes you got back; colonel...
What about them?
You wanted to see me?
I have spent the last hour on\nvideo-conference with
the Directors of the FBI;\nNSA and Homeland Security.
Your kind of tea party.
If Project Honor's compromised;\nit will cripple our intelligence networks.
Fine.
Oh; I can't believe I was so worried about that polygraph.
I mean; at NSA; they ask you everything.
As in; like; everything.
I'm surprised you guys don't have;
He thinks we're the CIA?
Why not?
CIA; FBI; NSA what difference does it make?
I have information to trade for my life.
ARES.
only temporary; but it's right across the street
from the building.
At NSA; we park off-site; like; half a mile away.
God forbid you forgot anything.
I took a picture.
wanted us to catch her; it was part of his plan.
He kept her in the dark intentionally. We need to find him.
There's a second team at NSA helping the FBI
run a high-frequency trace on any unexplained radio signals.
- We will. - Not in time.
You background her?
Not yet. What about Colford-Webb?
I know them. I dealt with them at NSA.
It's a DC-based company.
Provides technology and security services;
With her military background; our clients love her.
You do a lot of government work. Almost exclusively.
DOD; NSA; CIA-- basically; all the intelligence agencies.
Excuse me; gentlemen.
I heard NCIS was in the building.
And it worked; just... not the way I intended.
They killed my men and captured me.
Who? / CIA; NSA; hell; NCIS; for all I know.
These guys had black Ops stamped all over them.
They're stealing money to fund something
AFE was our cover.
And this is much bigger than you think.
NSA had agreements with all major biometric security companies to program a back door into their iris scanners.
Boss;"back door" is...
Yeah. Yeah; I know what it is; McGee.
Reappeared one year later as a major crime lord.
A severe personality shift.
Well; according to NSA and Interpol; Siravo's enterprise has spread to drug smuggling in Mexico;
kidnapping in Bolivia and an interest in a Ukraine pipeline.
His finger is in many eyes.
we got a partial from the bomb.
It was too partial-y for a search; but
you add in a little magical NSA wizard math fix-it; and voil√É¬†.
You got a hit. Yup; the print from the bomb
belongs to... Luke Pischedda.
But if this was retribution...
Someone should be taking credit.
Let me talk to NSA and Homeland;
get everyone's point of view.
Sir; if this gets any bigger
What do we know?
Interagency has nada--
CIA; FBI; NSA--
no one's reporting chatter about
Chief Warrant Officer William Reed's death.
[ Both grunting ]
The bugs in Dr. Santino's office...
developed by the NSA;
the same you gave me to bug Pittman.
Kind of sloppy; Tony. Don't you think?
√¢‚Ñ¢¬™ Winky Dog; Winky Dog √¢‚Ñ¢¬™ okay.
√¢‚Ñ¢¬™ Don't settle for no rinky dog √¢‚Ñ¢¬™
Developed by the NSA.
Adaptable to any cellphone.
Picks up voices at 50 feet.
I like you.
You want me to wear a wire?
This is an NSA-approved recording device.
You let him tie his own noose
and slip it around his neck.
Birkhoff; get Shadownet up and running.
All right; might take a minute.
Sonya's getting us an uplink to the NSA's sat servers;
give us an eye in the sky.
- NSA? - Yeah.
Sonya's getting us an uplink to the NSA's sat servers;
give us an eye in the sky.
- NSA? - Yeah.
Dad gave me access.
We're official now; remember?
According to his notes; Mr. Gordon was set
to report on evidence of an offshore Cayman account
that; according to NSA; was in Nikita Mears's name.
That's a lie.
Graham must have planted that evidence on Dale
What's up with that?
The shoe yet to drop.
This is the second time Graham has referenced NSA intel.
What; you think he's got a double-in-arms over there?
Could be.
Could be.
Can you hack into the FBI's communication logs?
Find who Graham has been communicating with at the NSA.
Gonna be a big list.
Not if you filter the results
and his mission is just beginning.
Hey; Birkhoff.
How's the NSA search going?
You find any doppelgangers yes
not yet; Shadowbot's still doing his thing.
You've got the wrong person!
Can you hack into the FBI's communication log?
Find who Amanda is communicating with at the NSA.
No matter how the FBI autopsy plays out;
this has already forced us to accelerate our time line.
following the assassination of...
Leaders officially have denied any involvement.
NSA intel confirms that Pakistani intelligence
paid $50 million to...
The payment was hidden by-- and I quote--
it'll blow the lid off this whole conspiracy.
No; it won't be that easy.
Shop's got another sleeper inside the NSA--
the one who's planting all this intel.
If they went to all the trouble for Alex;
Better than you?
Talk to me; Fletch.
Who's our next target-- Amanda's double inside the NSA?
Shh; shh.
Hey; whoa. This is Birkhoff's rig.
Okay.
Birkhoff can't seem to find our mystery man
at the NSA. It's Birkhoff. He'll get it.
Like he got the DNA hack?
Okay; when have you ever seen Birkhoff get handled like that?
Think about it.
Everything he is doing or not doing--
the NSA lead; the busted hack--
it's helping the other side.
What if Alex is in custody right now because of him?
This was buried on your laptop...
Ronald Peller.
That's him-- Amanda's double in the NSA.
Birkhoff covered it up.
Wait a minute. He thinks I'm a--
I can't let you kill him.
Chief strategy officer; cybercrimes unit--
catches hackers for the NSA.
That's not ironic.
He's a very big fish.
Your dad's a CSO with level-one clearance.
If he doesn't check in;
NSA starts looking-- it's protocol.
Now; does he have a comm device or not?
It's the glasses. They're full duplex.
What happens next?
You are gonna help me find the real impostor
who's inside the NSA.
See? They don't know what he is.
Or so it seems.
into any computer system in the world;
the cryptograph can be an incredibly powerful weapon.
That's great. Get it over to NSA.
I also believe that recovering the cryptograph
is proof of Division's benefit
James Powell?
Yeah.
Special agent Hawkins; NSA.
There's been an incident.
There was a private aircraft flying over
And ultimately his life.
So far; we have determined that your brain is more powerful
than an n.S.A. Supercomputer; but right now you can only hold
the information you process for about six hours;
so basically you're like..
Eight; nine and one makes ten. Thank you very much.
- Mike! - Yes; Dave.
- What is this? - An NSA water purification system.
It hooks up under the sink; has an activated carbon filter
which takes out chlorine; fluoride; lead; etc.
our techs have already I.D.'d four of them.
We got French;Israeli; Russian...
and our very own NSA.
And Ashby had to have known about it; too.
I mean; there's no way surveillance proswould've scratched the switch plate
Yeah; but he also said he's a nobody;
and we got half the world bugging his apartment.
What'd the NSA say?
Same thing they always do.
They're gonna get back to us.
-Um; it's work. -All right;I'll talk to you later.
-Hey. -Hey.
According to the NSA;
your guy over at Blackrain is right.
This "Janus List"--thing doesn't exist.
This is his calling card.
Calling card for who? For what?
I want to work with you; DARPA; NSA; CIA.
We're not going to hire you; we're going to prosecute you.
You need me to get to the cartels.
protection deal-- did it come through?
No; better-- Fort Meade.
The NSA wants him?
Alive; preferably.
So; looks like the NSA wants
The NSA wants him?
Alive; preferably.
So; looks like the NSA wants
to hire Augie.
What?
a good midlife crisis.
So Augie's going to work
for the NSA. - Yeah.
Well; at least now his brilliant mind's on our side.
I think he's a really good guy.
Hey; I want to know
how you got a top security clearance.
I did some consulting for the NSA.
The National Security Agency?
Yeah; a couple years ago; uh; Bob Tomkins called me.
I mean; I...
I'm just trying to get head around the fact
that my little brother consulted on an NSA issue
that went high enough up for you to call
the assistant director by his first name.
that went high enough up for you to call
the assistant director by his first name.
The NSA consults with a lot of mathematicians.
You know; you've never been really good
at keeping secrets... think about it.
Bowling.
After the fuss you made; I thought I'd give it a try.
I still can't believe you never told me you consulted for the NSA.
- It was nothing like this; you know? - I hope not; Charlie.
You know; I mean; a lot of stuff comes
He's with the homeland security guys in the conference room.
Great; 'cause I think I may have an answer for them.
mathematicians at the NSA tried to predict
other attacks by evaluating likely target choices
using a linear discriminant analysis.
What's it about?
There are letter groupings here that I've seen before
when I consulted for the NSA.
- What? - Standard code references
for a very specific type of operation.
You got it.
How'd you come by all this hard data on assassination techniques?
I have a friend at the NSA who has a friend at the... at the CIA.
Yeah; don't even tell me. You know what's interesting?
When a death must look accidental
and we just got to get going on ours.
Okay; the threat is real.
The NSA is reporting an increase in terrorist chatter.
We've intercepted funding and apprehended an active
participant in the plot; so we need to do anything
in northern Pakistan. Four months ago.
W-Wait a second; wait a second. How do you know?
Because I spoke to the NSA.
No. No. His...
His name was the one name that kept coming up.
W-we sighted the drone.
Can you give me a direction?
Nsa has a track on it.
So; yeah; we've got an exact track.
Wow; it's headed for the hangars at goathart air base.
Sure. Like the social network kind of thing; right?
Well; actually; since we're saying
that the NSA has a database of phone intercepts on this group;
I'll be using an analysis based on Byzantine fault-tolerance.
With aame like that; I don't even want to ask; Charlie.
That's probably asking a lot of the metaphor.
It is; but if there's enough information
on the NSA intercepts; then...
Okay; look; you pursue that; and we just got
to find out as much information about these two as we can.
Still; despite our best efforts; we've found nothing.
May... may I inquire
why the NSA is so interested in finding this yacht?
NSA; Never Say Anything;
I get it.
May... may I inquire
why the NSA is so interested in finding this yacht?
NSA; Never Say Anything;
I get it.
You haven't been able to find this boat
What's going on here? - You Eppes?
Yeah. - You look worse than your brother in all this.
And where are you guys from? - NSA.
Do you have any idea how many taxpayer dollars you wasted
sending us in the wrong direction?
Obviously; we're not;
so why don't we cut all the interagency crap and try to figure out what's going on?
Can you please tell me what is the NSA's interest in this?
Aw; come on; please; give me a break.
Okay.
Aw; come on; please; give me a break.
Okay.
NSA's been tracking an arms dealer named Hashim Aziz.
He's Pakistani; terrorist ties.
He's on every agency's watch list.
He's still alive.
No good deed goes unpunished; right?
Hey; come on; look; don't worry about those NSA guys.
You know what I do feel pretty bad about
is putting your stuff on the back burner.
Uh-huh. -Four units disappeared
from a Pakistani army base 12 weeks ago.
NSA's been tracking them.
They lost them crossing into Thailand;
but if you continue on that trajectory...
You gotta be pretty damn committed
to the cause to be smuggling missiles into the U.S.
NSA have any idea who the end customer is on this?
Hashim Aziz is an arms dealer at heart.
His politics would never keep him from selling to the highest bidder.
of eight million?
Your odds aren't good. - All right; so; you got anything?
I don't; but our friends at the NSA might.
After all; you guys have the most
comprehensive space-based surveillance
Cal Sci's consulting projects?
Oh; yeah.
My NSA clearance is suspended;
so; all really get to do now is... look.
My next paper's going to be titled
Now; he sure seems to have lost a step or two
off his stride.
Yeah; it's this NSA clearance thing.
I guess ere were more eggs in that basket than he realized.
Well; than any of us realized.
from which Lake made all of his transfers.
Well; I don't understand. Isn't the whole thing designed to stop you from doing that?
Charlie here's got the NSA hookup.
Oh; no.
Who do I owe in DC for this?
The phone was cloned.
Whoever killed him.
NSA has got this new technology
where you can download media from a cell phone
without the owner ever realizing;
Yes; I guess my work
in the cosmic microwave background had some relevance
to the NSA's satellite signals technology and; uh;
they contacted me last September.
Last September?
What about all the people you know in the science community?
What if you call one of them?
Well; Larry's **noise temper** project is an NSA initiative;
but you have to understand;
if NASA's questioning Larry's overall fitness...
and I'm back on the mission.
That is great; congratulations!
Apparently someone at the NSA did some arm-twisting...
They're the experts; off the record.
On the record:
Professor Fleinhardt.
Well; if you ever need to call...
I'll just put it on the NSA's tab.
I'll walk you outside.
I guess the next time I see you; you'll be into a space suit.
- We think so. - Hmm...
Well; a lot of these addresses are within a couple miles of the FBI.
Now I've learned from the NSA
that operatives will often schedule meeting places;
like; like months in advance.
We could apply; uh; frequency-domain processors.
And Larry can help;
'cause he worked with the NSA on noise analysis.
Yeah; I'll give it a whirl.
All right; great. Have at it.
Don't you ever wonder about your own work?
What about my work?
Well; you consult for the NSA; don't you?
of course you do.
So you're gonna tell me that everything you do will be used for good all the time?
Ooh.
I think I just inadvertently tweeted.
I've been doing a NSA-style keyword search
on the Internet to find mention of a gun matching Don's
on gun sellers' Web sites.
So we got no national security events in the area in the last 24 hours.
I'm running a Risk Measure with data from the railroad;
the chemical company;the NSA and the FBI Counter-terrorism Unit.
But a terrorist attack is not well-supported.
Right-- and what'd the dispatcher say?
What's going on?
I wanted to see if you knew anything about the CIA's Stargate program.
I thought maybe with your NSA clearance; you might have seen something somewhere.
Sure. Stargate.
Ludicrous waste of taxpayer money.
Okay; here we go.
Hmm; just as we thought; huh? All the data's been encrypted.
Well; come on; Charlie; you with all your NSA experience-- you can't break that?
Well; this discrete logarithm provides quite an obstacle.
You know what; Larry; that would really only be a problem
The tian xi was scheduled to load bicycle parts and paper pulp headed for vietnam next tuesday.
Instead;it pushed out of harbor this morning.
Nsa's satellite image is two hours old;but you can see she's just past the 12-mile mark.
What makes the tian xi really interesting is the bicycle parts
are being loaded by the china national export company;
She was gone.
Is this her?
Picked these up off of nsa's satellites.
This was time-stamped when the last f.b.i.
"incident" occurred.
He's thorough. You gotta give him that.
I've hooked up my heat signature to the database...
and linked into N.S.A.'s satellites.
The red dot you see should indicate where my location is.
Hopefully one of you guys can read a map...
Daniel: No postponing; no canceling; no excuses.
I mean it; Lewicki.
NSA's got nothing on me; Doc.
It's a waste of time. I'm doing fine.
Natalie: That's your defense mechanism talking.
Traced the I.P. address the guy used to send the reply from.
Came up empty.
Code breakers at the NSA come up with anything?
Nothing yet.
Well; then he better hurry up; because the Chicago postal workers
No; no; no; no. Alex; I-I...
you're a government agent. Admit it!
- No. - Who do you work for? C.I.A? N.S.A?
The Trilateral Commission?
I'm a doctor; Alex.
Oh; man!
What agency do you work for?
CIA? NSA?
INSCOM?
Why would a big agency like that care what happens to me?
Got to be 100 grand worth of hardware in this thing.
It's getting to be you can't tell
a search engine from the NSA.
- Don't be evil; my ass. - [Laughs]
[Cell phone vibrates]
I think all you ever wanted to do was protect people.
It's a wire-tap recording.
NSA or FISA. Government.
But you're not government.
No; I'm not.
Relevant and irrelevant.
Events that would cause massive loss of life were relevant;
so those would be passed along to the NSA or the FBI.
And the irrelevant information?
Every night at midnight; the machine erases it.
is from a small batch.
Uh; model number DH-950.
It's NSA certified.
This model is made exclusively
for government and military installations.
[Telephone hangs up]
The government wanted an open system.
That the NSA could control...
targeting individuals at whim?
But it's broken.
Where is the patient that was assigned to this room?
Oh; he was taken to Radiology.
Finch; Claypool's wife said he was NSA.
That fits.
I knew I'd heard Samaritan before.
That fits.
I knew I'd heard Samaritan before.
It was a classified NSA project.
which is clearly the time Claypool is living in.
Well; if Claypool was career NSA;
It was a classified NSA project.
which is clearly the time Claypool is living in.
Well; if Claypool was career NSA;
then he'd be read in on all sorts of top-secret information.
Information he's now shouting for anyone to hear.
Indeed.
I think I've identified the threat to Claypool.
As a longtime employee of the NSA;
he'd be a prime target for anyone obsessed
with exposing the government's secret surveillance operations.
Your job; Arthur.
My job?
You did work for the NSA?
Not in front of her.
Arthur--
That's why they're in a telecom building.
They can Jack into the feeds.
It's an NSA listening station.
I guess we'd better listen.
All right; Finch; Peck just got home.
effective immediately.
- Please; sir; you can't just-- - I need you out; Henry.
As of this moment; you can't work for the NSA.
In the seven years I've worked here;
the strongest drug I've taken is aspirin.
Hello?
Recognize that name; Finch?
Theodore Gibbons; deputy director of the NSA.
He's going over his boss' head; way over.
Whatever Peck's into; it's big.
and liquor stores all over the city.
He's probably handing them out to the homeless.
The NSA certainly taught him
how to scatter a digital footprint.
Finch; are you getting anything off Peck's phone?
but he had good luck finding a pinout
to hack the card reader at his office.
I believe Mr. Peck is planning to break into the NSA.
He's in.
So am I.
ruined my life.
Now I know why. This is the proof.
These are six reports I wrote for the NSA;
and six covert actions based on those reports.
In each case; a single name gets added to what I wrote;
Then there's this;
"Sibilance" is an internal audit
of the NSA intranet. It's totally routine--
Until they find signals
hidden just beyond the Shannon limit.
It should just be static; but there was data.
Someone is sneaking just as much data out
as the NSA is taking in.
To scan through all that;
you need an organization ten times our size.
about our group and who you've told.
Let's start with those two men I've seen you with.
Who are they? Feds? NSA?
I don't know; okay?
I don't know why they're helping me.
So without McCourt;
Samaritan doesn't get past Congress.
And Greer wouldn't get access to the NSA's surveillance feeds.
Then that's why we got his number.
He is the victim.
No guns; no police; just information.
What kind of information?
If the NSA provides us
with New York City's surveillance feeds;
we will find you a terrorist.
Perhaps even she was unaware.
Either way; she's working for the wrong side.
We have to find something. Have you tried the NSA?
We can't hack them; but we can go
to the NSA's sources; the back doors.
We have to find something. Have you tried the NSA?
We can't hack them; but we can go
to the NSA's sources; the back doors.
I'll do Google. You take Yahoo.
This is really nice.
he makes a phone call.
Wish we could hear what he was saying.
Unfortunately; we're not the NSA.
Vehicle must be new; 'cause look.
There are no plates.
give something back. This orwellian nightmare.
Is this is the government feeds?
Direct from NSA at Fort Meade.
That's every email; every phone call;
surveillance cameras...
I'm flattered; Alicia. Don't be.
My people want answers.
Your company has had the NSA feeds for three years.
Not my company; just me.
If congress knew about this machine you're building;
So you think the government would abuse this machine?
Denton Weeks has spent the last six months trying
to tunnel into the machine by way of the NSA feeds.
He's failed; but he'll keep trying.
And he won't be alone.
It appears Decima Technology has been dismantled
as a viable business entity; which makes me wonder;
who exactly is getting the NSA feeds?
We had a deal; Senator.
We get the feeds.
More government plates.
- These our other numbers? - Yes.
Head of the NSA; General Kyle Holcombe;
and Manuel Rivera; Senior Advisor to the President.
And what about the fifth number?
anything from biomedical reactors to--
The fastest computer ever built.
Maxwell's the corporate cover for an NSA lab.
And two days ago; somebody working
in that lab sent this.
Boy right there's my Snowden.
[Laughs] Snowden?
Edward Snowden cleaned the NSA's clock.
Yeah; now he's got to live in Russia.
Thing is; Snowden didn't work at the NSA.
Edward Snowden cleaned the NSA's clock.
Yeah; now he's got to live in Russia.
Thing is; Snowden didn't work at the NSA.
He worked at the satellite office.
That's bureaucracies for you.
Not a problem.
One more thing; Weeks.
Corwin had contact with an NSA analyst named Peck
right before she was killed.
Tried to bring Peck in; but he had assistance;
Get as far away from me as possible; Janet.
The closer you come; the more you'll suffer.
Those thumbs have gotten the attention of the FBI; Interpol; the NSA...
and agencies I've never heard of.
- Are you serious? - I've been taken off the case.
She'll be here soon. Just hold up your end of the deal.
I'll get you Scofield.
An NSA analyst sympathetic to our cause...
...got his hands on a phone conversation the president had with Terrence Steadman...
...two weeks after you supposedly killed him.
is also what we're going to use to set you free.
About a week ago; we finally got a break.
An NSA analyst sympathetic to our cause
finally worked his way up and got clearance
into the Echelon program.
Yeah; there is someone who might be able to help.
FERGUSON: Sir; there are over ten million faces in Los Angeles.
Even with NSA and CIA satellite links; we're going to be sifting
through millions of gigabytes of image data.
The chances of finding Don Self;
Is just a bunch of boring number crunching;
but I gotta tell you something; pal.
We're in deeper than the N.S.A.; okay?
Our investigations are very thorough.
So what did he spend it on? Was it ropes? Belts?
I have centres for disease control; environmental protection; food and drug;
NIH. And then there is homeland security;
customs and borders; FBI; CIA; NSA; FEMA.
They all now do science preparedness and response.
So why the heck do I need NorBAC?
Karen; it's Sydney.
KAREN: Finally.
Listen; Wayne Nugent from the NSA
Said a satellite picked up
Some guerrilla activity in your area.
Long story.
I need your help.
I need you to call Wayne Nugent at the NSA.
Tell him I need a big favor.
Sydney?
Trying their luck
Recovering that relic again.
I know the NSA won't be going public
With our secret any time soon.
[glass breaking]
(Sighs)
Guess I should've seen that coming.
Last month he thought the mailman was an NSA spy.
(Chuckles)
Although; to be fair;
But what about your mom?
You'd think she'd appreciate that I used the money I stole
from the N.S.A. to put her through night school;
but she just can't seem to get over the first part
or the "getting caught" part.
- Are you guessing? - No.
"Knowledge" means intelligence; and aggregators are gatherers.
K.A.G. is a contractor for the NSA.
National Security Agency? What did Natalie do for them?
- She was a computer engineer. - Passport's here. And this.
This is a very sensitive investigation; Susie.
Once it's logged in; anyone has access to it.
You don't think the NSA is watching us now; right?
Hmm. I wonder.
- Well; privacy is an illusion; Susie. - What do you mean?
- Well; privacy is an illusion; Susie. - What do you mean?
Well; your telephone and internet records
are all on file with the NSA.
- Are you ... are you sure? - Mine; too.
Well; satellites; drones; security cameras;
Well; then; you do the talking; James Bond.
Do you know how many private security companies
work for the NSA?
there are half a million non-government workers
with top-secret security clearance.
Do you know how many government agencies
there are conducting intelligence activities?
- 16. - We got the C.I.A.; D.I.A.; NSA;
NGA; NRO; Afisra; Inscom; MCIA; O.N.I;
O.I.C.I.; INR; CGI; FBI; D.E.A./O.N.S.I.; INR; and TFI.
No payment record. You wouldn't be able to trace it.
Exactly.
- Two red NSA badges. - The scarlet letter.
Red means you're about to lose your security clearance.
So someone's threatening Natalie and her fianc√©.
You can ask them.
You know what? Better yet; why don't you ask big brother?
NSA isn't the only agency that's watching us.
I got a parking fob; I got a building pass.
This is my ATM card.
Very good.
You see; "foxtrot Mike" is fort Meade.
The NSA has taken your John Doe.
He wasn't shot breaking in; was he?
He was shot breaking out.
Well; you know where I stand.
But you're going to have to check the forecast
in order to get a read on DIA or NSA.
Afraid I'm going to have to fight this one
with the army I have.
We picked up something out of a Malaysian cipher.
We're pulling down the same data
from NSA as you.
But the analysis we've done
is pointing to something unusual.
We ask for it; we get it.
FBI; homeland security; treasury;
CIA; NRO; NSA...
We are aware.
We like to share with our friends.
We see if we can't connect the dots there.
Still waiting on bnd for the George Boeck file.
But NSA's telling us
they may have Munich to Damascus intercepts
that might shed some light.
They employ three former senators;
a half dozen retired generals;
a former head of the NSA.
You sure?
Can you prove it?
His son's wedding in three days.
We need full audio and video surveillance.
I'll call NSA.
Kale; you take point
and get them the; the; the... Sigint.
new Jersey... setting up a temporary field office there
to interview some of Kateb's friends and family.
Team g; going to be working with NSA.
That's all I have for now.
Odds are he's gonna do whatever he's gonna do
Yeah. We figured something
was about to happen; and this morning;
NSA gave us the chatter to back that up.
So; we're compiling
everything we know about Kateb.
should be back in soon.
We're zeroing in?
Tanya; where are you with the NSA stuff?
I'm trying; okay? I'm reading.
I can only read as fast as I can read.
Fountain.
Fountain.
We got NSA's cooperation on the boeck wedding.
Well; that's an expensive piece of guesswork.
There's gonna be a live feed tonight
Trevor at Interpol.
Juan-- or Juan at the CIA.
Doug at the NSA...
Mm-hm.
Yeah; it just...
Can we still launch?
Negative. The failsafe codes
are routed through the NSA birds;
and those just went blind.
Then re-route!
where I shouldn't be pokin' around.
Ah; good lad.
NSA; Homeland Security;
real backdoor wet-job stuff here.
And the bottom line is...
You're ex-military.
Black ops.
Let me guess; CIA or NSA?
Wherever; whenever.
With powers like that; how could you lose in Iraq?
Yeah; I got it; thanks.
Yeah.
It's a standard NSA block cipher algorithm.
Should only take a minute or two.
Let's call that an outside estimate.
- Edison. - Nothing. I found nothing;
and I mean nothing. Not a whisper.
CIA; NSA; FBI...
No one anywhere is admitting that they have anyone in custody
in connection with the attempted assassination of the President;
that's gonna make you feel any safer.
I know it's inadmissible;
but if you sent that NSA tape to your bosses...
I can't.
But we could send it to someone else.
for ruining a good man's political career?
Should have thought of that before she called me.
I sent Chandler the NSA recording.
She wants to meet Publius.
- Good. - Good? Not good.
Sir; for my money; I'd start looking into
other intelligence avenues...
The N.S.A.; National Security Council.
I can provide you with reliable names;
oversee any sweeps you need.
What in the hell? We eat on that table. Liv.
This is Artie Hornbacher.
Four hours ago; Artie stole this from the N.S.A.
You stole from the National Security Agency?
I'm not in this. You're in this.
Artie.
- Sorry. - He says he's got evidence
the N.S.A.'s spying on American citizens.
What; like spying spying;
like spying on American citizens; here at home?
- I told you. - Check him out.
Arthur "Artie" Hornbacher...
Low-level N.S.A. Data entry specialist.
Kept the same job; same salary; for 16 years;
which is either admirable or pathetic;
It's just a report on border security.
It's just the firewall.
The N.S.A. protected this program with everything
in their arsenal; in case it ever got stolen; like right now.
Seriously; Liv; he's certifiable.
We can't take this guy on as a client.
Just 'cause he's weird doesn't mean he's crazy.
He thinks the N.S.A.'s trying to kill him.
- My story didn't make any sense at first. - Still doesn't.
- Everyone thought that I was crazy; too. - Still do.
from data entry all the way to the top;
to speak freely if they witness any abuse
or wrongdoings by their colleagues here at the N.S.A.
You know; let me check with our oversight board
and see if they've heard anything.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Come on. Did you try the...
It's dead. Okay; if we want to see it again;
I have to hack into the N.S.A.'s firewall.
How long would that take?
Um... 22 days.
Ha. Oh; I can be good cop.
Hell; I can be the sweet cop.
Someone stole a little something from the N.S.A.
They think they may have themselves a whistle-blower.
Concerning what?
Tell Harrison to take the partial license plate number
and see where it goes.
Pinning this murder on the N.S.A. is
how we corroborate Artie's story.
I'm on my way.
Where are you getting this?
Your little whistle-blower Artie;
the guy who stole Thorngate from the N.S.A.?
I am pretty sure the supreme court would consider
this administration spying on its citizens criminal behavior.
I waited all day. I can't wait any longer.
- Is that your cell? - What the hell?
Uh; there's this new technology that allows the N.S.A.
To hack into people's cell phones
and record whatever's happening in the room they're in.
Yeah; I watch the news; too.
I wrote the code for it.
You work for the N.S.A.?
I'm a junior engineer at McGregor Logistics.
They gave me a job right out of college;
They gave me a job right out of college;
promised me I'd be doing cutting edge research.
Then they won an N.S.A. contract.
Yeah; I'm the wrong person to ask for career advice.
I didn't know where else to go.
I'm leaving the cabinet briefings
and the White House schedule on your desk.
Also the minutes from yesterday's N.S.A. meetings.
I figure I would patch you
- into the White House for any intel updates. - Don't bother.
Find out if shelby moss was at work this morning.
Shelby Moss. That's...
David's N.S.A. girl. What's going on?
Vanessa Chandler was a no-show at the White House today.
Wait. Are you saying...
So you admit this was B613?
I am telling you bad things happen.
A reporter and an N.S.A. worker go missing.
A press secretary dies in a carjacking.
It's unfortunate. Life is unfortunate.
There's a hit out on us.
Which is why we all need to act now in unison.
Among the four of us; we've got the NSA;
we've got the times; we've got justice;
we've even got the white house.
Oh. Will I need a reservation? It's tomorrow.
That's too late for reservations.
Dude; you've hacked into the N.S.A.'s mainframe;
you don't think you can make yourself a dinner reservation?
Good point.
but would they prompt this kind of hostility against my kid?
We're compiling all threats; past and present.
The FBI; NSA;
Homeland; all the top computer guys
been trying to trace the sender.
But the ones that were about to start their descent...
56 of them... are out of comm range.
NSA's trying to work a satellite hook-up.
FBI's attempting a Morse code
signal from the observatory.
working on this as we speak.
All right;
listen; when the FBI and the NSA fail; do we get
some kind of bonus here? I'd be willing
to go double or nothing. I'm just saying. Toby...
How did your parents handle it?
Oh; I-I haven't spoken to them in ten years.
NSA satellite link failed.
Where the hell are your people?
That kid Toby doesn't exactly fill me with confidence.
Quickest grand you ever made.
What's that; for the phone hacking?
Oh; buyer was thrilled; said you should moonlight for the NSA.
Use it as a down payment on your own place.
Why do that when I could have a rich father-in-law
Or maybe he's a terrorist. Oh; my God!
What if it's some kind of terrorist plot?
Maybe we should call the F.B.I. or the N.S.A.
You know what the N.S.A. considers
the first significant sign that you're part
What if it's some kind of terrorist plot?
Maybe we should call the F.B.I. or the N.S.A.
You know what the N.S.A. considers
the first significant sign that you're part
- of a terrorist plot? - What?
Downloading sim card.
Obtaining call history.
Shipping call history to NSA.
They've got the numbers.
They're attempting to geolocate last contacts.
The pornographer whose site Farik was using
hacked his way back into Farik's transmission.
Even NSA was impressed with the guy.
They started where he left off;
they were able to trace his source physically.

and his cave dwelling Muslim militia
manage to outsmart the C.I.A.
the N.S.A. and the Pentagon.
Unless; uncle Sam was behind the whole thing.
Not me.
Parolees; please have your four digits ident number
ready for your counselors.
We get checked with N.S.A. for any intercepted foreign traffic
terminating at the subject location.
My guess is; he was somewhere in that building;
Pa; what are you doing?
Leaving early is how you got hurt in the first place.
How'd you know I was getting out? Your buddies at the NSA got my phone taped?
Mom sent me again.
She said she's baby-sitting on hell of those kids.
These? Sure;
Strong; agile -
Perfect for hacking the nsa mainframe.
Excuse me?
Special agent vanessa webber;
Both of you!
Trust me; Clark is not who you think he is.
Now; a couple calls to the NSA;
and we'll find out what he's hiding.
It doesn't matter! Because I love Clark.
Too many links.
Khurvin knows we're chasing him; so he'll strike quickly.
We just haven't got time. In the absence of the thousands of analysts at the NSA;
I have to say that I agree with Ruth.
I agree; of course; you're. . .you're right; only. . .
- The second one is; yes. - That doesn't sound like a good thing!
Come on! You've got your fingers in every agency.
You haven't heard anything? Military intelligence? NSA? CIA?
If it were military; I'd know about it. It's got to be civilian.
Anything strange going on at Nellis?
If the Al'Kesh is in orbit; they must have fixed the cloak; because SSN hasn't picked them up.
What about their locator beacons?
We're running a search through the NSA satellite system;
but all they'd have to do to avoid detection is change the frequency.
Odds are we're not gonna find anything.
So my stamp collection is safe. How does that help us find the gate?
If they want to use the beam; they'll have to keep using the beacons.
We could request NSA satellite time to see if we could detect the signal.
Do it.
M'zel.
The good news is it's definitely janus' secret lab.
The bad news is getting in was the easy part.
There are levels of encryption on all data here that even the most paranoid nsa agent wouldn't use.
I mean; it is deep.
Some of them are straight-up math ciphers; while others are ancient knowledge puzzles.
Find out what agency or JSOC teams are in the region
and as this thing flows; pay special attention
to NSA and "five eyes" back channels; okay?
Lucas; since you'll be briefing Skinner by the end of the week;
you should be on hand now.
A CIA flight was shot down over Mali
6 hours ago.
NSA tracked the call that ordered the attack to the compound.
Bombing the compound was simply a reprisal
for the loss of their plane.
Professional killer.
Come again?
CIA; NSA; one of them trained assassins...
Like in "Michael Clayton."
Right.
We don't.
Well; my condolences on the doppelgangers.
Now; who sent you? NSA? The Feeb?
March of Dimes?
Uh; Bobby Singer sent us.
How?
Well; this place isn't really...this.
It's a front for an N.S.A. listening post.
What are they listening for? Everything.
The U.S. government is quite the voyeur these days.
Except when it's accurate.
LEE: Do you know what this is?
This is a GPS signal picked up off NSA Carnivore.
Someone's tagged a live one.
Who?
Pentagon; DOD; White House.
Let me make a call; get you on a plane to DC.
LEE: Dr. Sherman; we briefed Joint Chiefs; White House; NSA.
(SPEAKlNG CROATlAN)
Yeah. I'll have Command fly him out tonight.
- But he got sloppy. He forgot one thing. - His teeth.
That's right; his teeth.
Two weeks ago; we matched a set of dental records on the NSA computer
with a Ronald Wald and a J. McKay in Chatsworth; California.
Now; after all these years; it just so happens
Soon.
"Soon"?
The nsa is cc'd
They have been leaning on d.C.
To borrow gary for an op they've got planned.
Soon.
"Soon"?
The nsa is cc'd
They have been leaning on d.c.
To borrow gary for an op they've got planned.
WHICH MEANS A BIG CORPORATE OR A GOVERNMENT STUDY.
YEAH; WHAT; D.O.D.;
N.S.A.; CENSUS BUREAU.
ODDS ARE; THIS IMAGE IS SITTING IN A GOVERNMENT COMPUTER
SOMEWHERE;
No.
- We're here to clean up your mess. - Where did they recruit you from?
- FBI? NSA? - Doesn't matter where I came from.
And suddenly you got a shot at a command of your own.
Well; you come and take it from me.
Culp softened you up a little bit.
It's the final tally.
Three agents dead; two n.s.a. Operatives;
concussions; broken bones;
stab wounds...
...DESERVES TO BE SHARED WITH MY...
HE HAS THE HIGHEST SECURITY CLEARANCE OF ANY ACADEMIC
THAT CONSULTS FOR NSA AND THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE.
FOR GOOD MONEY; SAYS HERE.
MAYBE NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR SHELBY.
you have my word that I'll get you where you need to be tonight.
To the hearing?
The N.S.A. hearing at the hotel.
That is my promise to you.
Now; in the meantime; we got to keep you somewhere safe...
I made a boo-boo; all right?
KRIPKE: I think the board will really appreciate
how well we're using that NSA grant; President Seibert.
Right here we have a micro-controlled plasma...
Wow. Looks like the Ganges on laundry day.
And without Cooper to defend our actions...
People love to decry big brother...
the NSA;
the government listening in on their most private lives;
yet they all willingly go online
He's probably worth more.
My CIA sources just confirmed
he's an NSA analyst... one of their best...
and only one of three people allowed to write and access
the security protocols and software.
That's why I employed you.
The bastard screwed us both here.
Your NSA geek is where you left him last night.
We're done. Don't contact me again.
Wait!
So many things.
But right now; I want some information.
Where is the NSA agent?
I have no idea.
He was handed off to the Courier.
With Dembe driving;
we might make it just in time to see him die.
If we find our NSA friend and he's still alive;
he might prove helpful.
You want Seth for your own reasons.
√¢‚Ñ¢¬™ This girl is only gonna break your heart √¢‚Ñ¢¬™
√¢‚Ñ¢¬™ No; I... √¢‚Ñ¢¬™
This man; the young NSA agent...
He allowed you access to the classified networks?
He did.
Assistant Director Harold Cooper.
Who the hell are you?
Agent in charge Galarza; NSA Special Projects.
Why are you detaining my people; Agent Galarza?
Your people had a piece of stolen technology in their possession.
Yes; but not from me.
Seems you've stirred up the borscht; Ivan.
Murdering that NSA troll got the FBI talking to the FSB.
Now you're neck-deep in the beets; Ivan.
They've issued an arrest order for you.
You could probably use the retirement money right about now.
You have no idea what I'm talking about; do you?
The hack in DC; the NSA agent--
it wasn't me.
Then who was it?
- Whose garbage are you combing through now? - Yours.
Shredded communications from private contractors
working with the DOJ; NSA; CIA; FBI--
- all the initials. - This is about the incursion.
When you called; you said something about numbers.
Call lab services.
Have them fit him with an AlphaChip RFID tag.
Assemble a full intel review. NSA. CIA.
What exactly do you want to know?
Everything.
Agent Navabi is on loan to our task force indefinitely.
You're the one who found Reddington.
I'm sorry. Are those real-time NSA feeds?
I hunted the guy for five years. How long did it take you?
Well; it was... uh; 74 days.
Ask it a question; it gives you the answer.
It's got a carnivore chip
and it combines NSA-level A.I. brain patterning software.
Wait; so I ask this machine a question like
what color shirt I'm gonna wear next Tuesday;
Who do you think Wolf is ?
I've narrowed it down to two possibilities...
State Department or NSA. Wherever he is; he's got his nose in deep.
How am I supposed to sleep with all this noise ?
What the hell are you doing here ?
At the jing zi institute in hong kong.
Turns out jing zi was part of a shadow organization
With ties to the nsa.
So she works for the government?
Not according to any official records.
or to whom.
Decrypting it has been made the top priority
for the NSA; CIA.
Data is being shared between departments and agencies.
Details we've learned at Inostranka
We've been able
to decrypt the first line of the message.
NSA just sent over a capture.
Well; put it up; Blake.
[Suspenseful music]
I was going over the hourly logs
across the departments.
According to the NSA; Jarvis personally ordered them
to redirect the surveillance satellite
that covers part of Asia-- an area in Tibet.
If you want me to do something; I need to know the reason.
This satellite is shared by NATO
but operated by your N.S.A.
I need it redirected.
Please repeat that back to me.
possibly setting up a base of operations.
Hey; some of these receipts have addresses and time stamps.
We can go into the N.S.A. satellite archive;
see if we can locate him...
At those places and times.
In place and ready.
It's time to begin.
N.S.A. won't let you access their Internet offsite.
But if protocols are like the Pentagon's;
I should be able to spoof the P.I.
Aberdeen; Maryland.
Uh; give me the date and the time.
N.S.A. satellites archive images
every 60 seconds over major cities.
There. That's Roman.
I assume that means you want to take the call?
Absolutely; put him through.
Have NSA throw everything they've got at tracing the call.
I already have them on it; sir.
Put it through.
I expect he'll make a call to Sophia any moment now.
And we're ready to decrypt it?
All of N.S.A.'s surveillance capabilities
are focused on agent Lee's cell phone.
He makes the call; we'll hear it.
And it is aimed right at us.
This is some kind of message.
We have to call the N.S.A. right now.
This is exactly the kind of anomaly
they asked us to look out for.
Mr. President...
it's Sophia.
N.S.A. has already been informed.
They're attempting to trace. Put her through.
This is President Martinez.
And you're...
Can't really say.
So NSA.
Gentlemen; you're off the hook.
The official cause of the damage to Tinkerbell 4
I dried it out in the oven...
How'd you get my name?
My friend at the NSA.
Who might that be exactly?
I really cannot say.
Donovan here?
And the entire D.C. Office
along with the DEA; the NSA;
and a few other high-ranking blowhards.
Hey; Ryan. You remember Brad Pitt.
So what do you have for me?
Strauss is being held
at an NSA terrorist unit downtown.
They've sent specialists from DC
in the process of interrogating him right now.
A press conference this morning
has not eased our nation's paranoia
as we've learned that FBI; CIA; and NSA
are now all in pursuit of Joe Carroll
and his cult of serial killers.
NEIL: All I want to do is
speak the truth; and I want to tell our users how little
my company's cooperated with these NSA subpoenas.
We know; and we're going...
Oh; and the NSA has asked us
my company's cooperated with these NSA subpoenas.
We know; and we're going...
Oh; and the NSA has asked us
over and over to provide user information
from our social networking sites.
Hey; Kalinda.
We need help on this Chumhum case.
We're suing the NSA.
KALINDA: Okay; what do you need from me?
CARY: Well; TechWeek is in town...
The law firm; Lockhart/Gardner; they're suing us.
You and me?
No. The NSA.
Yeah; take that one to the Systems Admin.
Check out the link I just sent you.
Were you warned of your gag order either before or after that talk?
No.
Were there NSA recruiters in the audience
- of that talk? - KLUGER: Okay; okay; okay.
I get it.
- What? - ALICIA: That's the amount
of stock value Chumhum has lost
due to its forced association with the NSA.
Okay.
We'll hear testimony tomorrow.
NEIL: I was trying to help the North Koreans
- until they backed out. - CARY: Why'd they back out?
NEIL: 'Cause they were afraid of the NSA;
the same as everybody else.
Did you give them this technology for free?
Freedom fighters; Your Honor.
Due to their association
with the NSA; Chumhum has lost the contract
to supply these freedom fighters with cell phones.
And other technologies.
and it's not about the money; either.
It's about the publicity value of Neil Gross
standing up to the NSA.
Okay; let's get going. I've made my decision;
and no one is gonna like it.
NEIL: All I want to do is
speak the truth; and I want to tell our users how little
my company's cooperated with these NSA subpoenas.
We know; and we're going...
Oh; and the NSA has asked us
my company's cooperated with these NSA subpoenas.
We know; and we're going...
Oh; and the NSA has asked us
over and over to provide user information
from our social networking sites.
Hey; Kalinda.
We need help on this Chumhum case.
We're suing the NSA.
KALINDA: Okay; what do you need from me?
CARY: Well; TechWeek is in town...
The law firm; Lockhart/Gardner; they're suing us.
You and me?
No. The NSA.
Yeah; take that one to the Systems Admin.
Check out the link I just sent you.
and I was mightily impressed; but no.
Prior restraint doesn't apply here.
The Second Circuit has ruled that NSA subpoenas are legal;
and gag orders are required for national security.
That ruling wasn't precedential; Your Honor.
As Kafkaesque as that sounds; I will sustain.
CARY: Have you ever
been served with a gag order regarding the NSA's requests...
sorry... hypothetical requests for access to users' data?
- No. - Thank you; sir.
PATRIC: We can do so much with technology;
and yet; when I was served with a warrant; I caved.
We gave the NSA e-mails; data; phone calls.
Not that many. Less than a hundred.
But still; we gave it to them.
So that was you; right?
Yes.
And you were discussing the extent of your cooperation with the NSA?
Do you mind voicing your answer?
- Yes; I was. - And did you receive
Do you mind voicing your answer?
- Yes; I was. - And did you receive
a cease and desist letter from the NSA after that talk?
PATRIC: No.
Were you warned of your gag order either before or after that talk?
Were you warned of your gag order either before or after that talk?
No.
Were there NSA recruiters in the audience
- of that talk? - KLUGER: Okay; okay; okay.
I get it.
Not if the government employees in question
were acting in a discretionary capacity.
Then produce someone from the NSA; so we can ask them
if they were acting in a discretionary capacity.
Got you there; Bobby.
- What? - ALICIA: That's the amount
of stock value Chumhum has lost
due to its forced association with the NSA.
Okay.
We'll hear testimony tomorrow.
That's enough.
(Sniffles)
HORTENSE: So you blame the NSA for losing you 20% of your user base?
- NEIL: Yes. - And there was
no other reason for the loss of so many users?
NEIL: I was trying to help the North Koreans
- until they backed out. - CARY: Why'd they back out?
NEIL: 'Cause they were afraid of the NSA;
the same as everybody else.
Did you give them this technology for free?
Freedom fighters; Your Honor.
Due to their association
with the NSA; Chumhum has lost the contract
to supply these freedom fighters with cell phones.
And other technologies.
CARY: That's why we asked to be heard in here; Your Honor.
Since Mr. Gross had the temerity
to question the NSA's gag order; we were afraid the government
may seize on any excuse to prosecute him.
Even his attempts to spread democracy in North Korea.
and it's not about the money; either.
It's about the publicity value of Neil Gross
standing up to the NSA.
Okay; let's get going. I've made my decision;
and no one is gonna like it.
KLUGER: So; appreciating the government's legitimate
national security concerns; I'm gonna find
that the NSA's gag order should remain in place.
However;
appreciating the legitimate free enterprise concerns of Mr. Gross;
where my legal team won a major victory for Chumhum
against these intrusions on all of our privacy rights
by the NSA!
(Crowd cheering) Yes.
Now; um...
I didn't do anything wrong.
I used it exactly the way I said I would.
You endangered an NSA warrant.
The subject knows she's being surveilled.
Look; you were encouraged to share
Have you ever heard of parallel construction?
- No. - All right; well;
this is a Reuters article on the NSA.
- The NSA? - Yeah.
They've been handing tips gleaned from their surveillance
- No. - All right; well;
this is a Reuters article on the NSA.
- The NSA? - Yeah.
They've been handing tips gleaned from their surveillance
on to other departments; including the DEA.
That's parallel construction.
Wait; so...
you're saying that the NSA is surveilling Bishop?
Yeah.
Or us.
Hello.
I need a lawyer.
You work for the NSA?
I'm an independent contractor.
- For the NSA? - Yes.
You work for the NSA?
I'm an independent contractor.
- For the NSA? - Yes.
- And... that's all you can tell us? - I think I'm in trouble.
- I need legal advice. - What kind of trouble?
They're... they're asking if anything confidential went home.
CLARKE: Alicia; hello.
DELLINGER: The NSA is no joke.
You can't talk on the phone; or e-mail or text about me
or anything to do with me.
(Knocks) Yes?
CARY: And this is what you say...
I work as an independent contractor for the NSA;
and I want to report wrongdoing within the company.
I'm sorry?
Clarke Hayden had his phone on speaker.
Cary was passing by; talking to someone
and he said something about the NSA.
- Maybe they're suing us again. - Shut up; J.
Let me hear it.
Let me hear it.
CLARKE: You have to look for a way to hand off non-billable tasks.
- CARY: Look; it's the NSA. - That's the value prop...
What? I couldn't hear anything. Turn it up.
CLARKE: ...have to look for a way to hand off non-billable tasks.
What? I couldn't hear anything. Turn it up.
CLARKE: ...have to look for a way to hand off non-billable tasks.
CARY: Look; it's the NSA.
CLARKE: That's value proposition of support staff.
- That's it. - Huh.
Hi.
Alicia was just saying we-we can't call her.
The NSA is listening to us.
How do you know this?
I can't say; but I believe the information is good.
to monitor a specific target?
Again; State Secrets; Your Honor.
JUDGE: About NSA surveillance.
Okay; next question.
Mr. Froines; have you ever assigned my client to a task?
So if you don't want to be in the papers;
I would strongly suggest that you use
your considerable influence with the NSA
to take us off any lists that we are on.
Do you understand me?
That's all. It was not classified when it
was given to Mr. Dellinger or when he took it home.
The NSA retroactively classified it
because the raid failed to produce the evidence
they were hoping to find.
Mm. I think it's the music.
Can we please turn it down a little?
And give the NSA a respite? No.
If it's driving you crazy; just think what it's doing to them.
Did you find out?
Jackie's there?
Yeah. Why?
Cary; this is exactly like the NSA.
We were outraged when they listened to us.
Clarke; I'm responsible for 60 employees.
KALINDA: 'Cause we have the texts
on your Lockhart/ Gardner cell phone.
How very NSA of you.
It's our cell phones; our property.
Did you ever make an accusation
One of them was mine.
Sayonara.
Get hold of John Donnelly at NSA.
And have him send over the security file
on Edgar Scoville.
the savings are gone; what does he have left of value?
Yeah; access to classified information.
On his last trip to NSA; Philcox accessed files he shouldn't
have; names of operatives operating in hot zones.
Well if that was he was dealing; then every
We're preaching to the converted.
Readership doesn't matter; man. It's the impact on the black ops that counts.
They read it too. The guys at the N.S.A. and the C.I.A.?
They tremble every time we put out one of these babies.
Do you think the people at E-Com-Con are trembling?
They had no idea who I was without the beard.
Oh; gee; a spy!
A concerned member of the N.S.A.S.
They were trying to take over his position.
And they were drooling over his date.
until we have conclusive evidence
that shows us something else; okay?
Call the NSA and see if they heard any chatter
about an attack; okay?
Sir; we found pieces from the case
What's up with the droid?
- She's listening to chatter. - Chatter?
Cia; nsa; interpol; local police.
They tend to ignore the important things;
So we keep an ear to their frequencies for anything that might require our special touch.
Yeah; the whole point is be skanky.
Well; I just don't know who's watching this; you know;
the NSA; that hot Edward Snowden guy.
I don't want this to be on; like; WikiLeaks.
It just kinda looks like a bathing suit my grandma might wear.
Knock; knock!
- Eddie: Who's there? - Detectives Diamond and Soto.
CIA; NSA?
- DOD? - NYPD.
Eddie; we're the good guys.
Did I or did I not establish credibility on May 1st?
You correctly predicted that we'd all be called to work; yes.
Sometimes at the NSA; we download a rolling bug
onto smartphones to slave the microphone.
You ever get an unwanted text message?
You're an IT guy.
My title is Assistant Deputy Director
of Technology and Systems; Cryptology; and Mathematics at NSA.
I'm gonna have to--
I product test software.
I'm gonna have to--
I product test software.
- NSA software? - Yes; sir.
Can you tell me about the software?
It's data mining.
Can you tell me about the software?
It's data mining.
One of the ways the NSA was tracking bin Laden;
or any terrorist for that matter;
was to write code that would sift through
We could hunt for terrorists legally;
but due to our bosses' devotion to GLOBAL CLARITY;
the NSA has been happily violating the Fourth Amendment;
USSID 18;
and about a dozen of the NSA's own regulations about spying on Americans.

USSID 18;
and about a dozen of the NSA's own regulations about spying on Americans.
You've got guys listening in on ex-wives;
dropping in on calls from soldiers overseas;
He was demonstrating his credibility.
His name is Solomon Hancock.
He works in software engineering at the NSA
and he handed me a stack of documents;
transcripts of his testimony describing illegal surveillance.
It absolutely does not.
We want you to lead the vetting of this source.
He's telling us about illegal surveillance at the NSA.
He's also telling us that TMI is in the same game as News of the World.
Jesus.
Jesus.
We're looking at a couple of scenarios; Jim.
One is that we're sitting on a scoop that could shake up the NSA
and maybe have the country take another look at the Patriot Act.
But the TMI element; doesn't that--
and you'll need to get into this guy's personal life
and you'll need to do it all
without raising any flags at the NSA.
Are you up for this?
- Yeah. - We don't need it fast; we need it right.
for a few weeks; I'm willing to pay that price.
The night we got bin Laden I got a call from an anonymous source.
He works in software engineering at the NSA.
We have to start vetting him and the documents.
You got some tweets from Congressman Weiner.
All right; what do you know so far?
- You got Lisa for tonight. - They've already started promoing it.
What do you have on the NSA source?
He's not rock solid.
( Sighs ) Shit.
but they didn't fire him. They just lowered his security clearance.
Yes; he's stalking his ex-wife and; yes; he tried to pick up a hooker;
but that doesn't mean he's lying about the NSA.
All we have are the transcripts of his testimony
and his testimony doesn't mean anything to me yet.
- There are about 19 different ways-- - The calls are encrypted.
I know how to find out who I am; but you don't.
- So you're with the NSA? - I am.
I'm with a unit that's been monitoring
illegal electronic surveillance.
WHY SO LONG TO MATCH IT?
WELL; THE FILE WAS ONLY DECLASSIFIED LAST MONTH.
WHAT WAS SHE DOING FOR THE N.S.A.?
HELL; YOU KNOW THOSE GUYS. THEY'RE NOT TALKING.
ALL I LEARNED IS THAT SHE LEFT THEM ABOUT 6 MONTHS AGO.
WELL; WE HANDLED A BOMB SCARE FOR HER A WHILE BACK.
SOME ANTI-ABORTION NUT GROUP.
ANYWAY; AFTER SHE SPLIT WITH THE N.S.A.
SHE WENT TO THE UNIVERSITY.
SHE LECTURES THERE TOMORROW;
MAYBE SOMEBODY GAVE US THE WRONG PRINTS;
OR MAYBE SOMEBODY SWITCHED THEIRS
WITH THOSE IN THE N.S.A.

SOMEBODY'S PRIORITIES ARE OUT OF WHACK.

IN ORDER TO COVER THEIR OWN TRACKS.
IN FACT; COULD YOU GIVE ME ANY INFORMATION
ABOUT THIS PROJECT YOU WERE WORKING ON AT N.S.A.
OR ANYBODY YOU WERE WORKING WITH?
MMM; I'M SORRY; THAT'S CLASSIFIED.
FEEL WHAT; DR. GIVENS?
[SIGHS] YOU KNOW WHY
THE N.S.A. WAS SO INTERESTED IN ME?
BECAUSE I COULD HAVE MADE
MY TIME MACHINE WORK EVEN THEN;
- This is not about- - As for the charges you're making...
they're more than serious; they're libelous.
Before I can so much as whisper it to anyone in the FBI or NSA...
I would need one hell of a lot more evidence than you've given me.
Good day; Doctor.
Additional documents will then be leaked to the press;
indicating that "Juggernaut"
is a code name for an NSA program
designed to increase tension in the Middle East
through the means of political assassination.
bypassing the satcom encryption
from my laptop; now that's gonna be the tricky part.
That is an NSA-level hack.
- How did you get started doing all this stuff?
- It's a long story; some other time.
So we won't say a thing. But just between us;
Are you a spy?
Yes; I work for the n.S.A.
My name is smith; james smith.
But you can call me smitty
You said you were with the c.I.A.
Yes; the condiment institute of america.
And you're with the n.S.A.
National sandwich alliance.
We could have sold that zero calorie mayo
of if they got someone waiting up ahead.
Daniel; what do we do now?
Kayla: Routing through centcom. Office of the nsa.
Put him through to the white house.
How the hell do i know? We're off the map.
ARE YOU CALLING IN AN AIR STRIKE?
CIA HAS LOCATED AHZMEH TOURS.
NSA FIND AIR CONNECTIONS IN THE NAME OF AHZMEH TOURS.
PARTY OF 19 TOURISTS CONNECTED
FROM LAHORE TO NEW DELI.
That's where the butcher was four months ago.
No;that's where he is now.
We checked with nsa.There's been chatter in that location.
We have a voice signature.And a possible visual here.
The butcher is 14 clicks out from here.
That guy that wa bringing you;
was he CIA ?
CIA; NSA; contractor; I don't know.
- And no sign of Mack ? - Not since we split up.
Wherever he's being held we gotta get him out before he breaks.
Hey. Where the hell were you? You didn't see those guys?
What guys?
C.I.A.; N.S.A.; I don't care. They were waiting for me.
No one went in; they've been waiting inside.
How'd they know I was there? You send'em?
Gentlemen; we are on lockdown until this job is finished.
[Beeping]
According to the N.S.A. Intercepts; this is the house they're to meet in.
It's at the end of the street. The guy on the left; there's your host.
And coming to his party are two senior controllers of the terror network.
The state secrets privilege in lawsuits
Involving torture; extraordinary rendition
And illegal n.S.A. Eavesdropping.
He blocked habeas corpus rights for enemy combatants;
Preserved military commissions and authorized; without due process;
Josh?
- Yeah? - Mr. Michael Gordon is here to see you.
- Does he have an appointment? - No; he's with the NSA.
- NSA? - Yeah.
Send him in.
- Yeah? - Mr. Michael Gordon is here to see you.
- Does he have an appointment? - No; he's with the NSA.
- NSA? - Yeah.
Send him in.
Mr. Lyman. Michael Gordon.
Send him in.
Mr. Lyman. Michael Gordon.
Donna says you're with the NSA.
I'm not here to bug your office.
Yeah; but you wouldn't tell me if you were.
Remember Donna had lunch with Mack's assistant a few weeks ago?
He told her there's a missile silo on the grounds.
She repeated it to a magazine and an NSA guy...
...came to see me just now and he said she struck a little close to home...
...and they want to investigate. In the meantime; they revoked her credentials.
...the president requested the intelligence finding you have in your hands now.
That finding has been prepared and signed off...
...by the directors of NSA and Central Intelligence.
It was subsequently submitted for review and approval...
...by the national security advisor...

We just got done with Helsinki and the reactor.
- Yes; sir. - How do we know?
The NSA's been monitoring web sites of the Bahji cell operating out of Syria.
They've been looking for picture codes; and they intercepted cellular calls.
Sir; that tracks with what our advisors in Kazakhstan gave us this morning.
Sir.
- Think about it. - Yes; sir.
NSA has new cellular intercepts.
The list now includes Dover in Delaware and Fort Myer in Maryland.
And they're close to putting the White House on the list.
Is that why "Force Depletion Estimate" is left blank here?
No; ma'am. Leo liked us to leave our number unpublished
until he got the NSA estimate.
That way; the two projections were decided independently.
But you would share your estimate with Leo?
- Harris Malbin; Pennsylvania party chair. - Harris.
Got Wallace from headquarters on turnout; Goodwin on legal contingencies...
...CIA briefer; former NSA Nancy McNally on Kazakhstan. How you doing?
A lot of people out there for an 8 a.m. Rally.
Let's try that again. How are you doing?
Can I maybe get some coffee?
- Where's McNally? - Sir?
Nancy McNally; NSA.
We were starting to get into the ramifications...
...of long-term troop deployment in Kazakhstan.
-Yes. -That's crap.
If the FBI had proof on Gault; they'd have told the world.
No; they wouldn't. Neither would the NSA or Central Intelligence.
You don't show someone you've broken their ciphers unless you have to.
Gault was Iong dead. Before he was; he was an agent called BIack Water.
...where he was awarded the Order of Lenin.
Y eah; well; I'II believe that when they show me the file.
-That's not an FBI file. -It's an NSA file.
I' m classified; but I don't have code-word clearance.
I know.
...that's what was said by my national security advisor 20 minutes ago...
...right after it was said by the secretaries of State and Defense.
And for what it's worth; the directors of the CIA; NSA; FBI...
...and Naval Intelligence agree.
Leo; isn't Minatom in terrible shape?
- Josh Lyman? - Yes.
You asked to see me?
Kate Harper. I'm the new deputy NSA.
- You're Commander Harper. - Kate's fine.
Sorry I haven't gotten around to introducing myself to everyone yet.
- Donna's MIA. - No; she's right here.
- What's the holdup? - I don't know.
I got a deputy NSA stuck in here with me.
Ask why we can't throw money at the system to fix these false alarms.
C.J. Cregg would like to know why we spend half our lives...
Mr. President; Leo McGarry is outside.
-He's been waiting? -Yes; and you're late. . .
-. . .for your NSA briefing on Chechnya. -Okay. Thanks.
-Thank you; Mr. President. -Knock again in five minutes.
-Yes; sir. -Thanks; Deb.
I don't know where all this restorative junk is from.
Every nap I've ever taken leaves me feeling groggy and on edge.
I hadn't noticed. The NSA called. Secretary of state.
NSA again; saying talk to her before talking to the secretary of state.
You're right.

You're right.
About so much.
...somewhat careful attention.
Thank you all for your time.
The NSA picked up the president-elect's phone call with the Russian president.
- We're tapping his phone? - In the current crisis...
...the NSA is monitoring all contact with the Russian...
The NSA picked up the president-elect's phone call with the Russian president.
- We're tapping his phone? - In the current crisis...
...the NSA is monitoring all contact with the Russian...
...and Chinese governments as a matter of course.
- And? - The Santos call contained...
...for the 21st century? - It does not.
Sir; we have a problem.
NSA monitors picked up a phone conversation...
...between President-Elect Santos and Chinese president; Lian.
- Yeah? - Sir; you're not gonna like what he said.
...regarding the international security situation in Kazakhstan?
I don't know what you're talking about.
The NSA reported he placed a call to China...
...in which he made it clear to President Lian...
...he has qualms about this intervention. - Back up. The NSA is bugging our calls?
The NSA reported he placed a call to China...
...in which he made it clear to President Lian...
...he has qualms about this intervention. - Back up. The NSA is bugging our calls?
Did you not sing an aria this morning...
...about how the president wants a hearts-and-flowers transition?
...about how the president wants a hearts-and-flowers transition?
Wiretapping is an odd way of showing love.
Don't overdramatize. The NSA monitors all communication with those governments.
We're this far from being in a state of war with them.
You need to talk to the congressman about mixed messages...
For now; we line up behind the president; sir.
How does anyone know what I said to the Chinese anyway?
The NSA is eavesdropping on all calls to Russia or China.
I want to meet with the president.
- Everybody's calls; sir; not just ours. - I want that meeting.
-How long to nail down the information? -A rabid Cuban-American community. . .
. . .could be involved. Old zealots; young hotheads and a ton of agencies.
-FBI; DEA; NSA; NIA; INS-- -Which doesn't answer my question.
We may never get a straight answer. Miami; South Florida; it's Chinatown.
I don't care. Pin it down.
. . .and launches into a speech of such length and intensity. . .
. . .it would've put away William Jennings Bryan.
NSA seems to think even if it is a false alarm; it may be significant.
That's kind of what Leo said.
Why do I feel that there's something going on with Leo. . .
Down home; back when.
And now he's gone.
-Probably only that NSA gal; huh? -Gal?
-You like repeating things; son? -I'm getting good at it.
You go back a couple of years; get her out of those power suits. . .
The president will be hung out to dry.
C.J.; why didn't anyone tell me?
-Excuse me? -I'm the deputy NSA. . .
. . .and I don't know Leo McGarry's in Cuba?
Yeah. How did you find out?
...we've been able to follow up on where Yossi received materials and financing.
...on the first of last month at Seaside Trust in San Mateo; California.
Sir; the NSA echelon shows the money originating from an account...
...at the Bank of Commercial Finance in Geneva.
The account balance totals a little over 18 million...
She's very protective of them; and it doesn't matter whether... You know.
-It took... -Wait.
It took three days to get the language through NSC and the NSA.
- It isn't coming out of the speech. - I didn't think so.
- Why are we here for an hour? - Members have drafted an insert.
They've started the bypass. We won't know anything for a couple hours.
Just make sure they haven't had a power outage. What's next?
You've got a few minutes before NSA.
Josh is in with House Democrats; if you want to sit in.
Nah; I'm fine.
- Who are you? - Somebody who's taken an interest in you.
In this case of yours. This case I gave you.
What are you? CIA? NSA?
- You're a brave boy. - You said you had information.
Control the board. Know which men to sacrifice and when.
ANSWER ME !
I WORK FOR THE NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY.
THE N.S.A. ?
SINCE WHEN DID THEY START ISSUING YOU GUYS PIANO WIRE...
INSTEAD OF GUNS ?
I DON'T KNOW.
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK ? I THINK YOU'RE A LIAR.
I DON'T THINK YOU WORK FOR THE N.S.A.; AND I DON'T THINK THERE'S A BOMB ON THIS TRAIN.
- YOU'RE CHOOSING A HELL OF A WAY TO FIND OUT. - SHUT UP !
[ Beeping ]
I DON'T KNOW.

If you were to call the police...
I would be detained only long enough...
for another NSA agent to authorize my release.
I don't exist as a citizen; nor does anyone I work with.
So what are you doing here?
I willfully participated in a campaign of misinformation.
Who do you think they were?
NSA; CIA; some organization Congress will uncover in the next scandal.
But what's important is what they have.
They have no idea because they called us in.
- All except Gelman. - Gelman was not one of them.
At 28; he was "the old man." Some say the brightest of all.
- He wrote some of the earliest viruses. - And was under investigation by the NSA.
- Is that why he disappeared? - Gelman?
Gelman was a visionary; not a capitalist. A subversive.
If my interpretation of certain data was a little lax;
it's because I've been under pressure to produce results.
My N.S.A. grant is up for renewal.
And Lucas knew how damaging his allegations would be!
Was Lucas Menand up for the same grant?
It's your call; Holtzman.
But I'm not accountable to anybody outside my subcommittee.
I don't care if it's the NSA or the Vatican police.
It's a defense satellite transmission.
You're kidding!
What?
You shouldn't have told 'em. They have no jurisdiction.
Mulder; they're NSA. They think the boy's a threat to national security.
How can an 8-year-old boy who can barely multiply be a threat to national security?
People call me paranoid.
You can't dodge what you don't see coming; Knowle; that's for sure.
That should tell you something about who you're dealing with.
Who am I dealing with? NSA? Secret Service? Military? Who?
You know better than that;John.
They shot the man in cold blood.
He runs a white power hate blog against President Sawyer.
Lovely. Jesus. Skip Tyler.
King of the hackers. Worked for the NSA.
Was fired for rewriting nuclear launch coordinates..
To target Apple headquarters.
I'm not supposed to talk to you right now.
Run a database search on the guys in that building.
CIA; NSA; everything you've got.
Okay; listen; Walker's not doing this for the money; trust me.
There is something else going on. I can't do that; ma'am.
Securing the vessel will be your first priority.
However; we've had a slight complication.
The NSA has informed us that the North Koreans
also detected the object.
They've dispatched a Kilo-class submarine to investigate.
Where are you taking me?
And who the fuck are you?
NSA? CIA?
Okay.
You're a fucking puppet; whoever you are.
So look like you blew the European operation.
But... I have that data.
Secure master codes; NSA Comsat matrixes...
NATO tactical scenarios.
It's a whole heap of shit that's not supposed to be floating around.
Jack Perkins was the agency's top field man; fucknuts.
If he doesn't want to be brought in; you're gonna die trying.
Why isn't the NSA handling this?
We're keeping this one in-house.
But Xavier was running Perkins though; right?
The DKE series is restricted.
Level 4 security.
Could be NSA... CIA.
Frank?
Let's move.
Maybe you are the leak.
I just want you home safe.
Everything on this drive came from the NSA mainframe.
But your creeper left a trail.
Look at the source codes. Find your mole.
to investigate our escapee?
And when that failed; you received covert assistance
from an N.S.A. Agent... Harold Stone?
Agent Fowler was a friend; sir.
His death...
I'm sorry that I strayed from procedure; but...
No apologies necessary.
N.S.A.? Very resourceful.
I'm impressed.
Thank you.
- Five seconds to a number. - No; it's fine.
We lost the trace.
I got a partial. We can check it with N.S.A.
I'm sorry.
The phone just dropped the call.
Marlow.
I need another favor.
We need one more N.S.A. Database search.
I only have a first name-- joseph.
Key words¬°¬™
might like to go off the record.
Justice keeps their nose clean.
Try Harold Stone; N.S.A. He's a friend. Use my name.
N.S.A.? You got skeletons in the closet I don't know about?
Not half as many as you. I'll be back in two hours.

I thought you wanted me to move to New York.
You're not the one I want dead.
I need you.
I just got off the phone with Harold Stone at N.S.A.
John doe has a name... Otis Whaley. No priors.
No priors? Then why is his name on the classifieds?
You just tell everybody everything around here?
Now; what you want to do
is get a sample over to; say; NTS or NSA.
Whoever. Have them run it through a mass spectrometer
or a nuclear magnetic resonance unit.
(cheering and applause)
MAN: Sir; the satellites are still showing no visual on our target.
NSA creeper.
MAN 2: Finding Dale Barbara
is essential. (scoffs) Good luck; dude.
Guy's messy; but he does nice work.
Cabrera wedding doesn't show up on any database.
The cia; fbi; nsa; it's just a dead end.
Give me that.
What are you doing?
Don't you think it's interesting that nobody
can find the intern; Hoda Amin?
You're telling me the NSA doesn't even know where she is?
I'm saying it's gonna get dirty.
And I want you to tread lightly here.
What you're asking me for...
if I hand it over to you; everyone will know.
The NSA; the CIA; Homeland.
I'll be through.
It's a breach I won't recover from.

Ambition. Focus on that.
Who; in the end; benefits the most?
Not the NSA.
Not the CIA.
- I still have que... - AL: Wait!
And this guy? Tucker Griffin. We know him as Arnold.
Has a lot of charges for online fraud and hacking.
NSA investigated him
for penetrating department of defense files;
but couldn't get anything to stick.
Anarchists and hackers. Great.
It could be anyone of the online groups.
Or disgruntled military or NSA type.
- And don't forget Hans Gruber. - I don't know Gruber.
- Really? Hans Gruber. - What?
Okay; now;
I sort of borrowed this highly-classified call-tracking program
that the FBI sort of borrowed from the NSA.
It's called Spider Bot. Like; how cool is that?
It; uh...
Duplicated with Brenner's and the last victims; the Trumans.
- A lot of data. - Which is why
I ran it through a NSA data mining search engine.
And found that.
What is that?
which will also probably be your fault.
- What's Google's number? - I don't know. Ask Jeeves.
Do you know anybody at the NSA?
Does anybody here know anybody at the NSA?
Oh; I see you here on this sad day.
- What's Google's number? - I don't know. Ask Jeeves.
Do you know anybody at the NSA?
Does anybody here know anybody at the NSA?
Oh; I see you here on this sad day.
Okay; that's Isaac Denisov from Change.org. She hates him.
actually a Pakistani general named Hamid Gul who was once
head of the ISI; which is kind of like the FBI; the CIA;
and the NSA all rolled into one; which made him at one
point one of the most powerful men in Pakistan.
Now; his views on the radicalization of the Army
Yeah. Even I'm getting a bad vibe.
No way. This building's closed.
NSA.
You do know what those letters stand for; right?
National Security--
Whoa. How'd you see that?
Just an old habit from my code-breaking days
at the NSA. Code.
That's computer code.
Of course!
Pete; his real name isn't even Artie Nielsen.
It's Artie Weisfelt.
He used to work for the NSA.
He was a cryptographer--a code breaker--
When he was in his 20s.
Silence from the landscaping department; please.
I set this system up.
I was a top NSA cryptographer.
You can't just-- - And I'm in.
Eh. Oh; well; they must have loosened up the security.
In the '70s; I had some dealings with the Soviet Union.
No; no; no. Artie; we know all that.
Okay; pre-Warehouse; you worked for the NSA.
You traded secrets to the Russians.
They were gonna charge you with treason.
Myka...
I'm sorry about your friend.
Ah; we sure missed you when you left the NSA.
Beauty and brains.
Thanks; Joe.
The coincidence doesn't escape me either.
If someone wanted Joe dead;
then NSA headquarters is not the easiest place
to take him out.
I think whatever they were after was right here.
And I want to know what.
You're never gonna get in.
The NSA's system is so much tighter than ours--
I'm in.
I'm surprised it took you that long.
I'm in.
I'm surprised it took you that long.
Maybe I shouldn't be here while you hack NSA files.
Well; the mainframe was not accessed;
so whatever they were looking for
Photographing me?
I followed him;
but by the time I got inside the NSA;
it was too late.
He left something on Mr. Sweetwood's body.
Look; why don't we just tell the cops who we are?
We're on the same team.
Yeah. NSA and ATF; both burglarizing an art gallery.
That won't lead to too many questions.
All right; gents.
Taught composition at temple.
Sent Artie to Juilliard.
But when he went to go work for the NSA;
his dad never talked to him again.
So how do we put that face
Usually grumpier. He's just distracted.
So what is this place anyway?
Uh; it looks like it might have been an old NSA safe house.
Now they obviously use it to shoot porn.
Hey; that's St. Jude; right?
You and Callaway spoke last night.
How do you know?
Some of those friends are at the NSA.
placed from Callaway's office.
Tapping the bureau. Reese...
I should have guessed it.
You've come a long way in two years.
NSA.
Before that; the Science and Resource Commission.
And before that; the old OSS with Joe Atkinson?
Look; we have photo sites on all our computers. Customers are around them all day.
Checking email; surfing the web...
- Hacking to the NSA. - CIA.
Right. I don't monitor the usage.
You don't remember who used the computers this morning?
- No; I can't compromise the mission. - Kim is loyal to the cause.
She can be useful to us.
I gave him a fabricated NSA documents; I said I got them from my father.
That got me into a meeting.
And they finally brought me into the group.
All this time you've been suggesting that there's a mole in my administration.
Well; perhaps it's your house that needs cleaning; colonel.
Not my house; mr. President. The NSA.
It appears that there's a breach in the agency. And I think that I have identified the source.
The deputy director.
We believe that stage three will be a major strike on a domestic target ...
time to coincide the upcoming elections.
Are you the NSA; *** like the military.
You do not understand.
These people are the military.
You got it.
All right; listen up people.
Colonel Amos was conducting an independent investigation under the authority of the NSA.
He was assigned on the case by general Carrington; who has since been arrested in charge with high treason.
And no time... no time did Colonel Amos have any direct communication with the White House or with the President.
You need to throw some people off our trail.
What kind of people?
The NSA; secret service; CIA.
Well; that's a tall order.
For anyone else.
I hacked the airport security for them...
I know there's more.
I set up a backdoor in the NSA for them...
Jones will be using it to check in.
You're on the road to buying your family some slack.
With all due respect to you; Sir;
I am no longer an employee of the US government.
I do not appreciate being kidnapped at the airport by NSA.
Kidnapped?
While we're tossing around legal terms;
Yeah; Chicago PD picked him up;
Michigan Ave at 2:18 in the morning.
Prints match the NSA file so he's definitely our guy.
It's a lucky break.
Yeah; there was a video interrogation
then it's time to get out of the business.
I want you to run these names through
every database. NSA; Pentagon; Interpol.
Day light or black query; how should I log it?
Log that anywhere I'll have you flying steerage to Syria.
I'm working off an old DUI but apparently
Chicago PD erased the arrest footage.
You slide his name through an NSA intercept?
Mmmhmm.
Then don't give up so easily.
Mmmhmm.
Then don't give up so easily.
Try out that new NSA security clearance of yours.
And Jones...
Yeah?
in his name wearing his favorite jacket
and a baseball cap.
When NSA pulls the tap
on the stations CCTV; it's not him.
What does that say to you?
Completely liquidated?
Yes. In large part due to
cooperation between CIA and NSA assets.
Good integration; people. Well done.
Who did the liquidating?
across the country; we can't access
the alert system until we are back up.
What about the N.S.A.?
They got hit worse than we did.
They're down to cans and string for the next 2 hours.
Here's the address she called you from.
Nice program.
NSA. Your tax dollars hard at work.
I suppose your going to do this alone?
Not entirely.
Frank Giordino is relieved
of all duties at the agency.
N.S.A. Operations has the wire.
They will cover all contact and agents in the field.
You will all be debriefed.
There's cake.
I want you to check all the sealed files;
C.I.A; N.S.A. on the Roman Numeral thing.
I'm willing to bet all our documentation is gone.
Giordino?
Traffic cameras got a hit on a car rented by Samantha Taylor;
travelling towards Green Falls; Colorado.
The information got passed onto the NSA before I could derail it.
What is XIII doing in Colorado?
I believe he's searching for his real identity.
How many calls since we touched down?
Four and counting.
He's gonna have NSA tapped into every security cam.
Well; my European contact was able to get us here
without being spotted.
on XIII and Jones.
Yes; Sir.
Any NSA information requests-- I want them vetted.
Confirm with the requesting department
by video conference before we release any intel.
This is Delta-Xray-Delta! Who the hell are you?
This is Simon Cruller; sir.
I'm a Sys Op working for the NSA.
(Radio) Camp Northern Light.
I have new orders for you from Cent Com.
This is Citizen Z broadcasting live via broadband; low band; VHF; UHF; Skynet.
If you can get a signal; then you can find me
thanks to our friends at the NSA.
Now all I need is somebody; anybody; everybody to get back to me
cuz that's how it starts. If you're still alive;
Doctor Merch?
I'm still working on that.
And you call yourself the NSA?
Quit looking at porn and find that quack.
We got business to settle.
We're on a high priority mission
to get this man to a CDC lab in California.
We were sent here by an Intell Officer from the NSA
to see General McCandles.
We need his help finding transpo.
